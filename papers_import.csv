An Empirical Study of Entrepreneurs’ Affect and Venture Effort,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/but49tn6167vy45i2wpzu/18-Foo-et-al.-2009.pdf?rlkey=tppopr7uzreasfvl6yrr0vqys&dl=0,"entrepreneurial affect, affect, venture effort, temporal focus, affect-as-information","To understand how feelings influence the effort of entrepreneurs, the authors used experience sampling methodology with 46 entrepreneurs over 24 days. The study found that negative affect directly predicts immediate venture effort, while positive affect predicts future-oriented venture effort through future temporal focus.",18 - Foo et al. 2009.pdf

Entrepreneurial Human Capital and the Persistence of Underperforming Firms,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bgc4g5rhi7tnqsvu17vrm/20-Gimeno-et-al.-1997.pdf?rlkey=dges3uvdjojwkdoqu6k8xjpgx&dl=0,"entrepreneurial human capital, organizational survival, economic performance, threshold model, new venture survival","This model explains why some firms survive while others with equal economic performance do not. It argues that organizational survival depends on a firm's own threshold of performance, which is influenced by the entrepreneur's human capital characteristics such as alternative employment opportunities, psychic income from entrepreneurship, and cost of switching to other occupations. The findings suggest that firms with low thresholds may choose to continue or survive despite comparatively low performance.",20 - Gimeno et al. 1997.pdf

Using patent-based metrics, it finds that while the quality of internal innovation declines post-IPO, public firms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation.","Bernstein, S. (2015).

On one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, they may enable entrepreneurial activity by offering work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in pursuit of an nascent venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform UberX into local areas.","Burtch, G., Carnahan, S., & Greenwood, B. N. (2018).

Using linked employee-employer data from the U.S. Census Bureau on legal services, we find that higher-earning employees are less likely to leave but if they do, are more likely to create a new venture than join another firm.
