We build on fragmented and disparate extant work to conceptualize the nature of entrepreneurial passion associ ated with salient entrepreneurial role identities. We also theorize the mechanisms of the experience of entrepreneurial passion that provide coherence to goal-directed cognitions and behaviors during the pursuit of entrepreneurial effectiveness. Passion is deeply embedded in the folklore suggest that entrepreneurship can be thought of and practice of entrepreneurship. Dating back to as a ""tale of passion"" (2005: 23), and Smilor goes Schumpeter's early writings (1951), researchers so far as to say that passion is ""perhaps the and practitioners alike have invoked passion to most observed phenomenon of the entrepreneur explain entrepreneurial behaviors that defy rea ial process"" (1997: 342). son-based explanations, such as unconven Despite the widespread fascination with en tional risk taking, uncommon intensity of focus, trepreneurial passion, it has not been studied and unwavering belief in a dream.

Research asserts that compassion may supplement traditional self-oriented motivations in encouraging social entrepreneurship. We draw on research on compassion and prosocial mo tivation to build a model of three mechanisms (integrative thinking, prosocial cost-benefit analysis, and commitment to alleviating others' suffering) that trans form compassion into social entrepreneurship, and we identify the institutional conditions under which they are most likely to do so. We conclude by discussing the model's contribution to and implications for the positive organizational schol arship literature, entrepreneurship literature, and social entrepreneurship literature.

In these industries, the ability to change continuously is a critical factor in the success of firms. In addition, what is also becoming apparent is that this continu- ous change is often played out through product innovation as firms change and ultimately even transform through continuously altering their products (Burgelman, 1991; Chakravarthy, 1997). A classic case is Hewlett-Packard, which changed from an instruments company to a computer firm through rapid, continuous product innovation, rather than through an abrupt, punctuated change. In firms under- going continuous change, innovation is intimately related to broader organization change. Yet research to date has revealed very little about the underlying structures and processes by which firms actually achieve continuous innovation and, ultimately, change. The purpose of this paper is to explore how organizations continuously change and thereby to extend thinking beyond the traditional punctuated equilibrium view, in which change is primarily seen as rare, risky, and episodic, to one in wh","Brown, S.
