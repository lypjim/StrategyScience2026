P001,The Nature and Experience of Entrepreneurial Passion,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/d9pjl8jumquynf7yasdoy/17-Cardon-et-al.-2009.pdf?rlkey=vmfy65gwr7xjjzbcfm0ip4vpw&dl=0,"entrepreneurial passion, goal-directed behaviors, role identities, emotions, identity theory","Entrepreneurial passion plays an important role in entrepreneurship, but theoretical understanding of what it is and what it does is lacking. We build on fragmented and disparate extant work to conceptualize the nature of entrepreneurial passion associated with salient entrepreneurial role identities. We also theorize the mechanisms of the experience of entrepreneurial passion that provide coherence to goal-directed cognitions and behaviors during the pursuit of entrepreneurial effectiveness. Passion is deeply embedded in the folklore suggest that entrepreneurship can be thought of and practice of entrepreneurship. Dating back to as a ""tale of passion"" (2005: 23), and Smilor goes so far as to say that passion is ""perhaps the most observed phenomenon of the entrepreneurial process"" (1997: 342). Despite the widespread fascination with entrepreneurial passion, it has not been studied systematically, and existing research is fragmented. Moreover, while emphasizing that passion is important for entrepreneurship, most studies neither adequately define entrepreneurial passion nor explain its role in the entrepreneurial process and its outcomes. We aim to fill this gap by developing a definition of the nature of entrepreneurial passion and theorizing about the experience of entrepreneurial passion to provide predictions about its influence in the entrepreneurial process.",17 - Cardon et al. 2009.pdf
P002,How Do Feelings Influence Effort? an Empirical Study of Entrepreneurs' Affect and Venture Effort,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/but49tn6167vy45i2wpzu/18-Foo-et-al.-2009.pdf?rlkey=tppopr7uzreasfvl6yrr0vqys&dl=0,"entrepreneurial affect, affect, venture effort, temporal focus, affect-as-information","Scholars investigating work motivation seek to understand what encourages people to expend effort on tasks. This is an important issue for the management field because efforts influence work outcomes (Latham & Pinder, 2005; Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002; Staw & Barsade, 1993). A vast body of evidence shows that affect impacts behavior through cognitive processes that influence how individuals prefer to act (e.g., Forgas, 1995; Gendolla, 2000; Isen & Labroo, 2003; Schwarz & Clore, 1996). Yet, despite the potential impact of affect on work behaviors, this factor plays only a marginal role in work motivation theories (cf. George & Brief, 1996; Seo, Barrett, & Bartunek, 2004). The affect–effort link has not been clearly established, even though scholars have long recognized the importance of effort in the work motivation literature (Latham & Pinder, 2005). This study concerns the relationship between the entrepreneur's affect and effort. To obtain data on this issue, the authors implemented experience sampling methodology in which 46 entrepreneurs used cell phones to provide reports on their affect, future temporal focus, and venture effort twice daily for 24 days. Drawing on the affect-as-information theory, the study found that entrepreneurs' negative affect directly predicts entrepreneurs' effort toward tasks that are required immediately. Results were consistent for within-day and next-day time lags. Extending the theory, the study found that positive affect predicts venture effort beyond what is immediately required and that this relationship is mediated by future temporal focus. The mediating effects were significant only for next-day outcomes. Implications of findings on the nature of the affect–effort relationship for different time lags are discussed.",18 - Foo et al. 2009.pdf
P003,Competing Models of Entrepreneurial Intentions,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/biyy0d7muzoyzcso3r8qq/19-Krueger-et-al.-2000.pdf?rlkey=4kcuxe63hy2dmsxpr5lqb0nbp&dl=0,"entrepreneurial intentions, theory of planned behavior, entrepreneurial event, intention models, psychological predictors","Why are intentions interesting to those who care about new venture formation? Entrepreneurship is a way of thinking that emphasizes opportunities over threats. The opportunity identification process is clearly an intentional process and therefore, entrepreneurial intentions merit our attention. Equally important, they offer a means to better explain—and predict—entrepreneurship. We don’t start a business as a reflex; we may respond to the conditions around us, such as an intriguing market niche, by starting a new venture. Yet, we think about it first; we process cues from the environment around us and set about constructing the perceived opportunity into a viable business proposition. In the psychological literature, intentions have proven the best predictor of planned behavior, particularly when that behavior is rare, hard to observe, or involves unpredictable time lags. New businesses emerge over time and involve considerable planning. Thus, entrepreneurship exactly fits the type of planned behavior (Bird 1988; Katz and Gartner 1988) for which intention models are ideally suited. If intention models prove useful in understanding business venture formation intentions, they offer a coherent, parsimonious, highly-generalizable, and robust theoretical framework for understanding and prediction. Empirically, we have learned that situational (for example, employment status or informational cues) or individual (for example, demographic characteristics or personality traits) variables are poor predictors. That is, predicting entrepreneurial activities by modeling only situational or personal factors usually resulted in disappointingly small explanatory power and even smaller predictive validity. Intention models offer us a significant opportunity to increase our ability to understand and predict entrepreneurial activity. The current study compares intention-based models in terms of their ability to predict entrepreneurial intentions: Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior (TPB) and Shapero’s model of the entrepreneurial event (SEE). Ajzen argues that intentions in general depend on perceptions of personal attractiveness, social norms, and feasibility. Shapero argues that entrepreneurial intentions depend on perceptions of personal desirability, feasibility, and propensity to act. We employed a competing models approach, comparing regression analyses results for the two models. We tested for overall statistical fit and how well the results supported each component of the models. The sample consisted of student subjects facing imminent career decisions. Results offered strong statistical support for both models. (1) Intentions are the single best predictor of any planned behavior, including entrepreneurship. Understanding the antecedents of intentions increases our understanding of the intended behavior. Attitudes influence behavior by their impact on intentions. Intentions and attitudes depend on the situation and person. Accordingly, intentions models will predict behavior better than either individual (for example, personality) or situational (for example, employment status) variables. Predictive power is critical to better post hoc explanations of entrepreneurial behavior; intentions models provide superior predictive validity. (2) Personal and situational variables typically have an indirect influence on entrepreneurship through influencing key attitudes and general motivation to act. For instance, role models will affect entrepreneurial intentions only if they change attitudes and beliefs such as perceived self-efficacy. Intention-based models describe how exogenous influences (for example, perceptions of resource availability) change intentions and, ultimately, venture creation. (3) The versatility and robustness of intention models support the broader use of comprehensive, theory-driven, testable process models in entrepreneurship research (MacMillan and Katz 1992). Intentional behavior helps explain and model why many entrepreneurs decide to start a business long before they can identify opportunities. Understanding intentions helps researchers and theoreticians understand related phenomena such as what triggers opportunity scanning, the sources of ideas for a business venture, and how the venture ultimately becomes a reality. Intentions-based models can describe how entrepreneurial training molds intentions in subsequent venture creation (for example, how does training in business plan writing change attitudes and intentions?). Past research has extensively explored aspects of new venture plans once written. Intentionality argues instead that we study the planning process itself for determinants of venturing behavior. We can apply intention models to other strategic decisions such as the decision to grow or exit a business. Researchers can model the intentions of critical stakeholders in the venture, such as venture capitalists’ intentions toward investing in a given company. Finally, management researchers can explore the overlaps between venture formation intentions and venture opportunity identification. Entrepreneurs themselves (and those who teach and train them) should benefit from a better understanding of their own motives. The lens provided by intentions affords them the opportunity to understand why they made certain choices in their vision of the new venture. Intentions-based models provide practical insight to any planned behavior. This allows us to better encourage the identification of personally-viable, personally-credible opportunities. Teachers, consultants, advisors, and entrepreneurs should benefit from a better general understanding of how intentions are formed, as well as specific insights into intentionality in entrepreneurship.",19 - Krueger et al. 2000.pdf

We argue that organizational survival is not strictly a function of economic performance but also depends on a firm's own threshold of performance. We apply this threshold model to the study of new venture survival, in which the threshold is determined by the entrepreneur's human capital characteristics, such as alternative employment opportunities, psychic income from entrepreneurship, and cost of switching to other occupations. Using a sample of 1,547 entrepreneurs of new businesses in the U.S., we find strong support for the model. The findings suggest that firms with low thresholds may choose to continue or survive despite comparatively low performance.",20 - Gimeno et al. 1997.pdf

To construct a firm-year panel dataset of all venture capital-backed biotechnology firms founded between 1980 and 2000, tracked yearly through 2006, we address the possibility of unobserved self-selection into exit mode using coarsened exact matching and two additional ways: (1) comparing firms that filed for an IPO (or announced a merger) with those not completing the transaction for reasons unrelated to innovation, and (2) using an instrumental variables approach. We find that innovation quality is highest under private ownership and lowest under public ownership, with acquisition intermediate between the two. Together with a set of within-exit mode analyses, these results are consistent with the proposition that information confidentiality mechanisms shape innovation outcomes. The results are not explained by inventor-level turnover following exit events or by firms’ pre-exit window dressing behavior.","Aggarwal, V. A., & Hsu, D. H. (2014).

While process management activities are beneficial for organizations in stable contexts, they are fundamentally inconsistent with all but incremental innovation and change. But dynamic capabilities are rooted in both exploitative and exploratory activities. We argue that process management activities must be buffered from exploratory activities and that ambidextrous organizational forms provide the complex contexts for these inconsistent activities to coexist.","Benner, M.

P008,Does Going Public Affect Innovation?,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/bhx4epittwb6k59yg71pp/Bernstein-S.-2015-.-Does-going-public-affect-innovation.pdf?rlkey=98b7z5tasek5zkm272lxukag3&dl=0,"innovation, going public, ipo, patent-based metrics, financial frictions","This paper investigates the effects of going public on innovation by comparing the innovation activity of firms that go public with firms that withdraw their initial public offering (IPO) filing and remain private. NASDAQ fluctuations during the book-building phase are used as an instrument for IPO completion. Using patent-based metrics, it is found that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, and firms experience both an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of the remaining inventors. However, public firms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation. The analysis reveals that going public changes firms' strategies in pursuing innovation. Theoretically, in frictionless financial markets, selling equities publicly should have no bearing on subsequent innovation activity. Under financial frictions, however, the transition to public equity markets improves firms’ access to capital, which can lead to an increase in innovation activity because such activity is particularly likely to be sensitive to financing constraints (Arrow (1962), Hall and Lerner (2010)). On the other hand, agency problems associated with the transition to public equity markets may undermine firm incentives to innovate (Berle and Means (1932), Jensen and Meckling (1976)). Ultimately, empirical investigation is necessary to disentangle the positive and adverse effects of public listing on innovation. Estimating these effects, however, is challenging due to an inherent selection bias associated with the decision to go public. A standard approach to studying the dynamics of firm outcomes around the IPO is to use within-firm variation. But as Jain and Kini (1994) note, firms choose to go public at a specific stage in their lifecycle, and as a result this approach may produce biased estimates of the IPO effect. For instance, if firms choose to go public following an innovation breakthrough, as argued by Pastor, Taylor, and Veronesi (2009), then post-IPO performance may reflect reversion to the mean and thereby mix life cycle effects with the IPO effect. To overcome this selection bias and estimate the IPO effect on innovation, I construct a sample of innovative firms that file an initial registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in an attempt to go public, and then either complete or withdraw their filing. Combined with standard patent-based metrics, this sample allows me to compare the innovation activity of firms that go public with that of private firms that intended to go public and hence are at a similar stage in their lifecycle. Of course, comparing complete and withdrawn IPO filings introduces a new bias associated with the decision of firms to withdraw the IPO filing and remain private. To address this concern, I use NASDAQ fluctuations over the two months following the IPO filing date as an instrument for IPO completion, relying on filers' sensitivity to aggregate stock market movements during the book-building phase. Consistent with prior literature, I find that these short-run NASDAQ fluctuations strongly predict IPO completion, with the effect concentrated at market declines (e.g., Busaba, Benveniste, and Guo (2001), Benveniste et al. (2003)). In the analysis, the IPO effect is identified from differences in long-run innovation (i.e., innovation over a five-year period) between firms that file to go public in the same year but experienced different post-filing NASDAQ returns. For the instrument to be valid, it needs to satisfy the exclusion restriction condition, that is, two-month NASDAQ returns must be related to the long-run innovation measures only through the IPO completion choice. I find empirical support for the validity of the instrument (see Section II.C for a detailed discussion). While reduced-form analysis shows that the instrument significantly explains long-run innovation, it may also affect innovation through other channels. To the extent that this is the case, two-month NASDAQ returns should also explain long-run innovation outside the book-building phase. A placebo test reveals that outside the book-building phase, when ownership choice is fixed, NASDAQ returns have no effect on long-run innovation. This finding is consistent with the instrument's validity. DOES THE TRANSITION TO PUBLIC EQUITY MARKETS AFFECT INNOVATION? THIS QUESTION IS IMPORTANT GIVEN THE CRITICAL ROLE OF INNOVATION IN PROMOTING ECONOMIC GROWTH (Solow (1957)) AND THE PREVALENCE OF TECHNOLOGICAL FIRMS IN THE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) MARKET OVER RECENT YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ALL FIRMS THAT HAVE GONE PUBLIC IN THE LAST 40 YEARS ARE TECHNOLOGICAL FIRMS.","Bernstein, S. (2015). Does going public affect innovation.pdf"

According to decades-old formulas, you write a business plan, pitch it to investors, assemble a team, introduce a product, and start selling as hard as you can. The odds are not with you: As new research by Harvard Business School’s Shikhar Ghosh shows, 75% of all start-ups fail. But recently an important countervailing force has emerged, one that can make the process of starting a company less risky. It’s a methodology called the “lean start-up,” and it favors experimentation over elaborate planning, customer feedback over intuition, and iterative design over traditional big design up front development. Although the methodology is just a few years old, its concepts—such as launching a minimum viable product (MVP) and pivoting—have taken root in the start-up world. Business schools have already begun adapting their curricula to teach them. The lean start-up movement hasn’t gone totally mainstream, however, and we have yet to feel its full impact. In many ways it is roughly where the big data movement was five years ago—a buzzword that’s not yet widely understood, whose implications companies are just beginning to grasp. But as its practices spread, they’re turning conventional wisdom about entrepreneurship on its head. New ventures of all kinds are attempting to improve their chances of success by following its principles of failing fast and continually learning.

We use two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter, the world’s largest reward-based crowdfunding platform, and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey. Results indicate a negative and significant relationship between platform entry and both measures of entrepreneurial activity. Importantly, the effect manifests primarily among unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns and unincorporated entrepreneurial ventures, suggesting that gig-economy platforms predominantly reduce lower quality entrepreneurial activity, seemingly by offering viable employment for the unemployed and underemployed.

We present a model grounded in a study of the world disk drive industry that charts the process through which the demands of a firm’s customers shape the allocation of resources in technological innovation—a model that links theories of resource dependence and resource allocation. We show that established firms led the industry in developing technologies of every sort—even radical ones—whenever the technologies addressed existing customers’ needs. The same firms failed to develop simpler technologies that initially were only useful in emerging markets, because impetus coalesces behind, and resources are allocated to, programs targeting powerful customers. Projects targeted at technologies for which no customers yet exist languish for lack of impetus and resources. Because the rate of technical progress can exceed the performance demanded in a market, technologies which initially can only be used in emerging markets later can invade mainstream ones, carrying entrant firms to victory over established companies. Students of management have marveled at how hard it is for firms to repeat their success when technology or markets change, for good reason: there are lots of examples. For instance, no leading computer manufacturer has been able to replicate its initial success when subsequent architectural technologies and their corresponding markets emerged. IBM created and continues to dominate the mainframe segment, but it missed by many years the emergence of the minicomputer architecture and market. The minicomputer was developed, and its market applications exploited, by firms such as Digital Equipment and Data General. While very successful in their initial markets, the minicomputer makers largely missed the advent of the desktop computer: a market which was created by entrants such as Apple, Commodore, and Tandy, and only later by IBM. The engineering workstation leaders were Apollo, but even they failed to capitalize on the emergence of the personal computer. The failure of leading firms can sometimes be ascribed to managerial myopia or organizational lethargy, or to insufficient resources or expertise. For example, cotton-spinners simply lacked the human, financial and technological resources to compete when DuPont brought synthetic fibers into the apparel industry. But in many instances, the firms that missed important innovations suffered none of these problems. They had their competitive antennae up; aggressively invested in new products and technologies; and listened astutely to their customers. Yet they still lost their positions of leadership. This paper examines why and under what circumstances financially strong, customer-sensitive, technologically deep, and rationally managed organizations may fail to adopt critical new technologies or enter important markets—failures to innovate which have led to the decline of once-great firms. Our conclusion is that a primary reason why such firms lose their positions of industry leadership when faced with certain types of technological change has little to do with technology itself—with its degree of newness or difficulty, relative to the skills and experience of the firm. Rather, they fail because they listen too carefully to their customers—and customers place stringent limits on the strategies firms can and cannot pursue.

We point to a normative agenda that emphasizes the need for decision makers—including managers, firms, entrepreneurs, and startups—to develop their own theories. Our argument is that decision makers should be like scientists and use the scientific method—theories, causal reasoning, and experimentation—to problem solve and generate new data and value. In this paper and special issue introduction, we discuss the foundations of the theory-based view (TBV), particularly as it relates to forward-looking reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. Rather than handing prescriptive theories to others, the goal of the TBV is to provide the scaffolding for economic actors themselves to develop their own, idiosyncratic theories. Theories are built on heterogeneous beliefs and causal reasoning that enable the generation of unique paths to value. We discuss the implications of this argument for key theories within strategy and economics, along with highlighting research opportunities at the nexus of the TBV and topics such as learning, entrepreneurship, finance, ownership, and leadership. We also introduce the special issue papers and discuss their contributions to the TBV.","Felin, Gambardella, & Zenger SS 2024 Theory-based decisions - Foundations and introduction.pdf"

In this paper we contrast two approaches: lean startup and the theory-based view of startups. The lean startup movement has served an important function in calling for a normative and scientific approach to startups and venture creation, while the theory-based view shares this agenda but emphasizes different underlying theoretical mechanisms and practical prescriptions. We highlight these differences and their implications for both research and practice. For example, we contrast lean startup’s emphasis on bounded rationality and entrepreneur–customer information asymmetry with the theory-based view’s emphasis on generative rationality and belief asymmetry. The theory-based view focuses on contrarian beliefs, associated problem formulation, and the development of a startup-specific causal logic for experimentation, resource acquisition, and problem solving. The right mix of entrepreneurial actions is contingent and startup-specific—guided by a startup’s unique theory. After pointing out differences between the lean and theory-based views of startups, we discuss opportunities for partial reconciliation as well as opportunities for empirically comparing perspectives. Overall, we emphasize that a scientific method for startups needs to recognize the importance of contingent, discriminating alignment between entrepreneurial theories and the actions they prescribe (including different types of experimentation and validation, search, and forms of organization).","Felin, Gambardella, Novelli, & Zenger JOM 2024 A scientific method for startups.pdf"

This paper attempts to clarify the meaning of structural inertia and to derive propositions about structural inertia from an explicit evolutionary model. The proposed theory treats high levels of structural inertia as a consequence of a selection process rather than as a precondition for selection. It also considers how the strength of inertial forces varies with age, size, and complexity. Most prominent organization theories argue that selection processes tend to favor variability in organizational characteristics, that is, diversity, through reference to the history of adaptations by individual organizations. Earlier (Hannan and Freeman, 1977), we challenged this view and argued that adaptation of organizational structures to environments occurs principally at the population level, with forms of organization replacing each other as conditions change. This initial statement of population ecology theory rested on a number of simplifying assumptions. A major one was the premise that individual organizations are subject to strong inertial forces, that is, that they seldom succeeded in making radical changes in strategy and structure in the face of environmental threats. How strong are inertial forces on organizational structure? This question is substantively interesting in its own right. It is also strategically important, because the claim that adaptation theories of organizational change should be supplemented by population ecology theories depends partly on these inertial forces being strong. Many popularized discussions of evolution suggest that selection processes invariably favor adaptable forms of life. In fact, the theory of evolution makes no such claim, as we made clear earlier (Hannan and Freeman, 1977; Freeman and Hannan, 1983). This paper goes beyond our earlier theory in acknowledging that organizational changes of some kinds occur frequently and that organizations sometimes even manage to make radical changes in strategies and structures. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that inertial pressures on most features of organizational structure are quite strong—much stronger than most theorists acknowledge. Moreover, the assumption that organizations rarely make such changes is only loosely coupled with the drivers of organization change. BACKGROUND: For wide classes of organizations there are very strong inertial pressures on structure arising from both internal arrangements (for example, internal politics) and from the environment (for example, public legitimation of organizational activity). There are legal and other barriers to entry and exit from realms of activity. Exchange relations with other organizations constitute an investment that is not written off lightly. Finally, attempting radical structural change often threatens legitimacy; the loss of institutional support may be devastating.","Hannan, Freeman, 1984, Structural Inertia and Organizational Change.pdf"

This paper explores the interaction of such capabilities with a critical strategic activity: the development of new products and processes. In responding to environmental and market changes, development projects become the focal point for tension between innovation and the status quo—microcosms of the paradoxical organizational struggle to maintain, yet renew or replace core capabilities. Core capabilities are considered core if they differentiate a company strategically. The concept is not new; various authors have called them competences (Snow and Hrebiniak, 1980; Hitt and Ireland, 1985), core or organizational competencies (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990; Hayes et al., 1988), firm-specific competence (Pavitt, 1991), resource deployments (Hofer and Schendel, 1978), and invisible assets (Itami with Roehl, 1987). Their strategic significance has been discussed for decades, stimulated by research such as Rumelt’s (1974) discovery that of nine diversification strategies, the two that were built on an existing skill or resource base in the firm were associated with the highest performance. Mitchell’s (1989) observation that industry-specific capabilities increased the likelihood a firm could exploit a new technology within that industry has confirmed the early work. On the other hand, institutionalized capabilities may lead to ‘incumbent inertia’ (Lieberman and Montgomery, 1988) in the face of environmental changes. Technological discontinuities can enhance or destroy existing competencies within an industry (Tushman and Anderson, 1986). Such shifts in the external environment resonate within the organization, so that even ‘seemingly minor’ innovations can undermine the usefulness of deeply embedded knowledge (Henderson and Clark, 1990). The paper examines two new concepts about core capabilities. First, while core capabilities are traditionally treated as clusters of distinct technical systems, skills, and managerial systems, these dimensions of capabilities are deeply rooted in values, which constitute an often overlooked but critical fourth dimension. Second, traditional core capabilities have a downside that inhibits innovation, here called core rigidities. Managers of new product and process development projects thus face a paradox: how to take advantage of core capabilities without being hampered by their dysfunctional side. Twenty case studies of new product and process development projects in five firms provide illustrative data. The paper concludes with a discussion of the project-capabilities interaction as a paradox faced by project managers, observed management tactics, and the potential of product/process development projects to stimulate change.","Leonard‐Barton,1992 - Core capabilities and core rigidities  A paradox in managing new product development.pdf"

This paper explores a legal constraint on mobility—employee non-compete agreements—by exploiting Michigan’s apparently inadvertent 1985 reversal of its non-compete enforcement policy as a natural experiment. Using a differences-in-differences approach, and controlling for changes in the auto industry central to Michigan’s economy, we find that the enforcement of non-competes indeed attenuates mobility. Moreover, non-compete enforcement decreases mobility more sharply for inventors with firm-specific skills and for those who specialize in narrow technical fields. The results speak to the literature on employee mobility while offering a credibly exogenous source of variation that can extend previous research on the implications of such mobility.","Marx, M., Strumsky, D., & Fleming, L.

I exploit a quasi-experiment involving failed mergers to generate exogenous variation in acquisition outcomes of target firms. A difference-in-differences estimation reveals that, relative to failed targets, firms acquired in diversifying mergers produce both a smaller number of innovations and also less-novel innovations, where innovations are measured using patent-based metrics. The treatment effect is amplified if the acquiring conglomerate operates a more active internal capital market and is largely driven by inventors becoming less productive after the merger rather than inventor exits. Concurrently, acquirers move R&D activity outside the boundary of the firm via the use of strategic alliances and joint ventures. There is complementary evidence that conglomerates with more novel R&D tend to operate with decentralized R&D budgets. These findings suggest that conglomerate organizational form affects the allocation and productivity of resources.","Seru, A. (2014).

Drawing on Austrian economics, this article portrays the recognition of such opportunities as distinctive cognitive feats whose accomplishment is conditioned by an entrepreneur’s prior experience and education. In-depth case studies demonstrate the multiple opportunities that can arise from a single innovation. The article argues that opportunity discovery is a function of the distribution of information in society (Hayek 1945). Through in-depth case studies of eight sets of entrepreneurs who exploit a single MIT invention, I show results that challenge the core assumptions of neoclassical economic and psychological theories about entrepreneurship. These findings suggest that: (1) Entrepreneurs do not always select between alternative market opportunities for new technologies; (2) The source of entrepreneurship lies in differences in information about opportunities; (3) The results of prior studies of entrepreneurial exploitation may suffer from bias; and (4) Individual differences influence the opportunities that people discover, how their entrepreneurial efforts are organized, and how the government can influence this process. Austrian economics challenges the validity of these assumptions, arguing that different people will discover different opportunities in a given technological change because they possess different prior knowledge.","Shane, S.

The impact of noncompetene enforceability on new firms is ambiguous since noncompetes reduce knowledge leakage but impose hiring costs. However, we posit that enforceability screens formation of within-industry spinouts (WSOs) relative to non-WSOs by dissuading founders with lower human capital. Using data on 5.5 million new firms, we find greater enforceability is associated with fewer WSOs, but relatively to non-WSOs, WSOs that are created tend to start and stay larger, are founded by higher-earners, and are more likely to survive their initial years. In contrast, we find no impact on non-WSO entry and a negative effect on size and short-term survival.","Starr, E., Balasubramanian, N., & Sakakibara, M. (2018).

This paper explores the fit and usefulness of beliefs in guiding these actions (Bremner & Eisenhardt, 2022). Given our heavy focus on action throughout this paper, we must assume that the real objection here is to our analogy and characterization of entrepreneurs as scientists—individuals who seek to understand problems and create solutions in a science-like manner. In Sergeeva et al.’s (2022) framing, scientists only learn, while engineers and designers do and act. Therefore, by associative logic, because entrepreneurs act, they cannot be scientists, or at least not solely scientists. However, for us and for pragmatism, the label ""scientist"" is not a role but an approach—a set of cognitive and physical actions focused on solving problems at hand. In a thoughtful comment on our paper (Zellweger & Zenger, Forthcoming), Sergeeva, Bhardwaj, and Dimov (2022) joined us in advocating for a pragmatist perspective on entrepreneurship. The authors suggested that entrepreneurs are more than scientists seeking to understand their world but rather are engineers, designers, and artists who act to produce value within it. They also situated our pragmatist perspective within the epistemological creation versus discovery debate and cast us into the discovery camp where entrepreneurs merely seek to discover a future that already objectively exists in the present. In response, we wholeheartedly agree with Sergeeva et al. (2022) that entrepreneurs are more than scientists who only seek to understand their world but rather are individuals who act within it to create value through new products or services (Casson, 1982; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000). In Zellweger and Zenger (Forthcoming), we highlighted a broad scope of action through which entrepreneurs seek to produce value under uncertainty. Entrepreneurs find and frame problems that surround them. They compose theories to solve these problems, test assumptions related to the theories, and compose preliminary hypotheses. Second, while we reject the placement of our perspective in the discovery camp, we argue that our entrepreneur-as-scientist perspective, and pragmatism more generally, finds little use for the made versus found distinction. It is precisely in settings of uncertainty—in settings of ""unknown unknowns""—that a scientific approach is particularly valuable. Here, both entrepreneurs and scientists select problems with unknown solutions, advance conjectures or theories about how to compose them, and seek evidence that tests what they form. Consistent with pragmatist thinking, we simply reject any real distinction between ""real scientists"" and any other category of individual in their mode of scientific inquiry and problem-solving. In fact, for pragmatists, even real scientists are better thought of as solving puzzles than as gradually disclosing the true nature of things (Rorty, 2007b: 77). Consequently, any difference between ""real scientists"" and entrepreneurs lies solely in the problems with which they are directly concerned, not in their respective logics.",Zellweger & Zenger AMR 2022 Entrepreneurs as scientists - A pragmatist alternative to the creation-discovery debate.pdf

However, this sequence of entrepreneurial actions arrives with a set of companion doubts: namely, doubt about product–market fit because the entrepreneurs’ beliefs are self-chosen; doubt about feedback validity from false positives or false negatives; and doubt about over- and under-fitting in response to feedback. We discuss the rationality of heuristics deployed by the entrepreneur to overcome these doubts. Our insights contribute to the microfoundations of entrepreneurial action and strategy by explaining how entrepreneurs generate the information to produce value out of uncertainty. It is not certain that everything is uncertain; causal (Delmar & Shane, 2003) or effectual logic—Blaise Pascal (Sarasvathy, 2001)—and whether it demands primarily thinking, such as ideation (Kier & McMullen, 2020) and personal judgment (Foss & Klein, 2012), or simply exploratory action (Murray & Tripsas, 2004) followed by related learning (Ott et al., 2017). Beyond such debates, we lack insight into how singular entrepreneurial actions combine to form a coherent entrepreneurial process through which entrepreneurs seek and produce value under uncertainty. Recent literature that characterizes entrepreneurial action as quasi-scientific provides a potential path forward here, where entrepreneurs act like scientists. They develop theories, test hypotheses, validate them, and experiment to create value under uncertainty (e.g., Camuffo et al., 2020; Felin et al., 2019; Felin & Zenger, 2009; Ries, 2011). However, this emerging literature is itself fragmented with some pointing to the benefit of rapid iterative testing as discussed in the lean startup literature (e.g., Blank, 2013; Kerr et al., 2014; Leatherbee & Katila, 2020), and others highlighting theory formation and problem framing that might precede such experimentation (Felin et al., 2020; Felin & Zenger, 2009). Prior work has yet to articulate the broad set of actions inherent to a scientific approach to entrepreneurship, and has failed to discuss how these actions are sequenced and combined through a quasi-scientific entrepreneurial process. For instance, while entrepreneurs may form hypotheses and test them, “interpreting the results of these tests” is, as Shepherd and Gruber (2021: 968) noted, both challenging and deserving of more research. Our aim in this paper is to build an integrative entrepreneur-as-scientist perspective of entrepreneurial action. The perspective we advance explores the scope of science-like behavior deployed by entrepreneurs and clarifies the related inferential challenges that complicate value creation under uncertainty. Our entrepreneur-as-scientist perspective explores how entrepreneurs use distinct categories of “scientific” action to generate the information necessary for them to transform uncertainty into risk (Ellsberg, 1961). Much like academic scientists, who advance knowledge by composing and testing theories about what is presently unknown (Felin et al., 2020), entrepreneurs similarly craft beliefs about a problem in the market and beyond.",Zellweger & Zenger AMR 2023 Entrepreneurs as scientists - A pragmatist approach to producing value out of uncertainty.pdf
