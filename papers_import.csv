Why might firms be regarded as astutely managed at one point, yet subsequently lose their positions of industry leadership when faced with technological change? We present a model, grounded in a study of the world disk drive industry, that charts the process through which the demands of a firm ’s customers shape the allocation of resources in technological innovation- a model that links theories of resource dependence and resource allocation. We show that established firms led the industry in developing technologies of every sort-even radical ones- whenever the technologies addressed existing customers’ needs. The same firms failed to develop simpler technologies that initially were only useful in emerging markets, because impetus coalesces behind, and resources are allocated to, programs targeting powetjid customers. Projects targeted at technologies for which no customers yet exist languish for lack of impetus and resources. Because the rate of technical progress can exceed the performance demanded in a market, technologies which initially can only be used in emerging markets later can invade mainstream ones, carrying entrant firms to victory over established companies.

In theory, patents can benefit their holders by deterring copycats and by serving as defensive shields in litigation suits, as bargaining chips in licens- ing negotiations, and as signaling devices to attract investors and customers (Budish, Roin, and Williams (2016)).

We point to a normative agenda that emphasizes the need for decision makers—including managers, firms, entrepreneurs, and Copyright: © 2024 INFORMS startups—to develop their own theories. Our argument is that decision makers should be like scientists and use the scientific method—theories, causal reasoning, and experimentation—to problem solve and generate new data and value. In this paper and special issue introduction, we discuss the foundations of the theory-based view (TBV), particularly as it relates to forward- looking reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. Rather than handing prescriptive theories to others, the goal of the TBV is to provide the scaffolding for economic actors them- selves to develop their own, idiosyncratic theories. Theories are built on heterogeneous beliefs and causal reasoning that enable the generation of unique paths to value. We discuss the impli- cations of this argument for key theories within strategy and economics, along with highlight- ing research opportunities at the nexus of the TBV and topics such as learning, entrepreneurship, finance, ownership and leadership. We also introduce the special issue papers and discuss their contributions to the TBV.

In this paper we contrast two approaches: lean startup and the theory-based view of startups. The lean startup movement has served an important function in calling for a normative and scientific approach to startups and venture creation. The theory-based view shares this agenda. But there are dif- ferences in the underlying theoretical mechanisms and practical prescriptions suggested by each approach. We highlight these differences and their implications for both research and practice. For example, we contrast lean startup’s emphasis on bounded rationality and entre- preneur–customer information asymmetry with the theory-based view’s emphasis on generative rationality and belief asymmetry. The theory-based view focuses on contrarian beliefs, associ- ated problem formulation, and the development of a startup-specific causal logic for experimen-","Felin, Gambardella, Novelli, & Zenger JOM 2024 A scientific method for startups.pdf"

The focus is on financial market reasons for underinvestment in innovation that persist even in the absence of externality-induced underinvestment. The conclusions are that 1) small and new innovative firms experience high costs of capital that are only partly mitigated by the presence of venture capital; 2) evidence for high costs of R&D capital for large firms is mixed, although these firms do prefer internal funds for financing these investments; 3) there are limits to venture capital as a solution to the funding gap, especially in countries where public equity markets are not highly developed; and 4) further study of governmental seed capital and subsidy programs using quasi-experimental methods is warranted.","Hall, B.

This paper examines the nature of the core capabilities of a firm, focusing in particular on their interaction with new product and process development projects. Two new concepts about core capabilities are explored here. First, while core capabilities are traditionally treated as clusters of distinct technical systems, skills, and managerial systems, these dimensions of capabilities are deeply rooted in values, which constitute an often overlooked but critical fourth dimension. Second, traditional core capabilities have a down side that inhibits innovation, here called core rigidities. Managers of new product and process development projects thus face a paradox: how to take advantage of core capabilities without being hampered by their dysfunctional pip side. Such projects play an important role in emerging strategies by highlighting the need for change and leading the way. Twenty case studies of new product and process development projects in five firms provide illustrative data. INTRODUCTION literature, and describe a field-based study providing illustrative data.
