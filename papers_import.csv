This paper builds on fragmented extant work to conceptualize the nature of entrepreneurial passion associated with salient entrepreneurial role identities and theorizes the mechanisms that provide coherence to goal-directed cognitions and behaviors during the pursuit of entrepreneurial effectiveness.,17 - Cardon et al. 2009.pdf
P002,How Do Feelings Influence Effort? an Empirical Study of Entrepreneurs' Affect and Venture Effort,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/but49tn6167vy45i2wpzu/18-Foo-et-al.-2009.pdf?rlkey=tppopr7uzreasfvl6yrr0vqys&dl=0,"entrepreneurial affect, affect, venture effort, temporal focus, affect-as-information","This study investigates how feelings influence the effort of entrepreneurs. Using experience sampling methodology, data were collected from 46 entrepreneurs over 24 days. The findings support the affect-as-information theory, showing that negative affect directly predicts immediate task-related effort, while positive affect predicts future-oriented effort beyond what is immediately required, mediated by future temporal focus.",18 - Foo et al. 2009.pdf

Intention models are well-suited to predict planned behavior like entrepreneurship because new businesses require significant planning. The study compares Ajzen’s theory of planned behavior (TPB) and Shapero’s model of the entrepreneurial event (SEE), finding strong statistical support for both, emphasizing the importance of intentions as the best predictor of entrepreneurial activities.",19 - Krueger et al. 2000.pdf

The authors argue that firms with lower thresholds may continue to operate despite poor performance, influenced by factors such as entrepreneurial human capital characteristics like alternative employment opportunities and psychic income from entrepreneurship. Using data from 1,547 new U.S. businesses, the study supports this model.",20 - Gimeno et al. 1997.pdf

The motivations behind this phenomenon remain undertheorized, but research suggests that compassion can supplement traditional self-oriented motivations. This paper builds a model of three mechanisms—integrative thinking, prosocial cost-benefit analysis, and commitment to alleviating others' suffering—that transform compassion into social entrepreneurship. It also identifies the institutional conditions under which these mechanisms are most likely to occur.",21 - Miller et al. 2012.pdf

Using a firm-year panel dataset of venture capital-backed biotechnology firms founded between 1980 and 2000, we find that innovation quality is highest under private ownership and lowest under public ownership, with acquisition intermediate between the two. These results suggest that information confidentiality mechanisms shape innovation outcomes.","Aggarwal, V. A., & Hsu, D. H. (2014). Entrepreneurial exit and innovation.pdf"

We develop a contingency view of process management's influence on both technological innovation and organizational adaptation, arguing that while process management activities are beneficial in stable contexts, they are fundamentally inconsistent with all but incremental innovation and change. Ambidextrous organizational forms provide the complex contexts for these inconsistent activities to coexist.","Benner, M. J., & Tushman, M. L. (2003).

Using patent-based metrics, it finds that the quality of internal innovation declines following the IPO, leading to an exodus of skilled inventors and a decline in the productivity of remaining inventors. However, public firms attract new human capital and acquire external innovation.","Bernstein, S. (2015). Does going public affect innovation.pdf"

However, a methodology called the ""lean start-up"" is emerging as a countervailing force that can make the process less risky by favoring experimentation over elaborate planning and customer feedback over intuition.

Successful firms blend limited structure with extensive communication to create improvisation within current projects, rely on a wide variety of low-cost probes into the future, and link present and future through rhythmic, time-paced transition processes. The research challenges the punctuated equilibrium model by focusing on the endemic nature of continuous change in high-velocity industries.","Brown, S. L., & Eisenhardt, K. M. (1997).

On one hand, such platforms may reduce entrepreneurial activity by offering stable employment for the unemployed and underemployed. On the other hand, they may enable entrepreneurial activity by providing work flexibility that allows the entrepreneur to redeploy resources strategically in pursuit of an ascending venture. To resolve this tension, we examine the entry of the ridesharing platform UberX into local areas using two measures of entrepreneurial activity: crowdfunding campaign launches at Kickstarter and levels of self-employment from the Current Population Survey.","Burtch, G., Carnahan, S., & Greenwood, B.

Established firms led the industry in developing technologies addressing existing customers' needs but failed to develop simpler technologies for emerging markets, as these were not seen as immediately profitable.","Chistensen, Bower, 1996 Customer power, strategic investment, and the failure of leading firms.pdf"
