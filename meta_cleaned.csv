Analyzing 29 U.S. universities from 1862 to 2024 using archival data, contemporary rankings, and enrollment records, I find that all land-grant universities—whether designated through luck, serendipity, or both—excel in agriculture and mechanical arts (A&M) compared to counterfactual peers, consistent with the Morrill Acts’ mandates. Yet, universities whose designations involved greater serendipity maintain A&M excellence more persistently than those driven predominantly by luck. Further, serendipity-dominant universities expanded beyond their original A&M mandates more successfully than luck-dominant ones. This study contributes to imprinting theory by revealing how organizational agency during founding shapes imprint durability and adaptability. It also advances luck and serendipity research by showing how varying compositions of chance events create distinct paths that resist change, providing one answer to why organizations exhibit persistent heterogeneity.","imprinting, serendipity, luck, firm heterogeneity",F_3HOAHd5Yvqt71V7,Luck and serendipity of universities - Strategy Science Conference.pdf,764830,application/pdf

Yet, little is known about why incumbents often prefer late entry or why startups choose to compete as non-followers. Conceptualizing complementary human capital as a superior resource, this study abductively develops the most plausible explanation for these “why” questions through the lens of first-mover advantages (FMA). Drawing on quantitative data on biopharmaceutical innovations since the 1980s, the study traces the process of becoming innovators in the biologics market back to human capital at founding, revealing divergent innovation pathways between incumbents and startups. To explain this variability, a comparative historical analysis of innovators that collectively formed the first group of non-follower pioneers in gene therapy, which emerged from the biologics market, shows that only incumbents were able to achieve first-mover advantages and/or benefits across the two markets. Although lacking such advantages, non-follower startup pioneers competed by forming founding teams with complementary human capital grounded in academic entrepreneurship and by creating value through serial entrepreneurship. In contrast, solely founded startup pioneers compensated for their lack of complementary human capital through employee entrepreneurship.","complementary human capital, first-mover advantages, founding teams, market entry, resource-based view",F_22YA9XxZ9cVzzz2,Accelerating Innovation through Complementary Human Capital.pdf,295324,application/pdf

Early Exploration Strategies and Commercialization of Deeptech Ventures","This paper examines how early exploration strategies, sequential or parallel, shape the financial and innovation trajectories of deeptech ventures. These firms must navigate multiple dimensions of uncertainty, including technological feasibility. Moreover, they rely on physical assets to commercialize, making exploration costly. Prior research on entrepreneurial strategy emphasizes experimentation to resolve uncertainty but largely focuses on asset-light settings such as software. Even lean startup methods, which encourage early commercial exploration, are better suited to digital ventures where uncertainty is primarily market-based. Consequently, less is known about the implications of exploration strategy in high-uncertainty, asset-intensive environments. I assembled a novel longitudinal dataset of 13,790 hardware-oriented ventures using primary and archival sources, augmented by machine learning and NLP. Employing multiple empirical strategies, including an exogenous technological development (3D printing), the study finds that parallel exploration improves early commercial outcomes by accelerating market learning and mitigating information frictions, yet risks premature technological lock-in. In contrast, sequential exploration fosters deeper learning, yielding long-run financial and innovation performance.
These results highlight the trade-offs faced by boundedly rational entrepreneurs as they balance resolving uncertainty with enhancing organizational learning. The study extends research on entrepreneurial strategy and experimentation to asset-intensive contexts and delineates the boundary conditions under which lean methods are effective in scaling science and technology ventures.",parallel exploration; organizational learning; science & technology; entrepreneurial strategy; additive manufacturing. ,F_tMupfT8UtwjgrxT,Lean Thinking DeepImpact_Exploration Strategies and Commercialization of Deeptech Ventures.pdf,1139005,application/pdf

Central to this process is a fundamental tension between novelty and feasibility that evaluators, operating under bounded rationality, cannot consider simultaneously and therefore rely on heuristics to guide their evaluations. A common heuristic is criteria-sequencing, in which evaluators prioritize alternative criteria at different evaluation stages. Yet, the idiosyncratic ways evaluators sequence these criteria often introduce inconsistencies, creating significant path dependencies in the process. In this paper, we propose that artificial intelligence (AI) offers a potential lever to structure evaluators’ criteria-sequencing heuristics. Leveraging a field experiment with 353 evaluators, we investigate how the sequencing of AI recommendations focusing on novelty and feasibility shapes the mean and variance of innovation among selected solutions. Our results reveal a mean–variance innovation tradeoff: a feasibility-then-novelty sequence leads to selections with higher mean innovation, whereas a novelty-then-feasibility sequence yields selections with greater innovation variance. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis uncovers that the format accompanying AI recommendations also matters. A dynamic format (i.e., interactive chatbot) increases the innovation variance among selected solutions but reduces their mean innovation relative to a static format (i.e., fixed explanatory content). Because these effects operate independently, our findings show that in AI-augmented evaluations, both the sequence of criteria and the format accompanying AI recommendations shape the mean–variance innovation tradeoff. These differences have important implications for the composition of innovation portfolios. Our paper contributes to innovation evaluation research and to emerging literature on human–AI collaboration in innovation-related contexts.",Innovation evaluation; human-AI collaboration; generative AI and predictive AI; novelty and feasibility; field experiment.,F_STRRWJnLu9ZlFER,StrategyScience_The Mean-Variance Tradeoff.pdf,1020032,application/pdf

Analyzing 29,021 quarterly observations from 722 funds managed by 811 general partners between 1997 and 2022, we document statistically significant, albeit modest, effects of GPs on performance persistence. These magnitudes are substantially smaller than those found in the literature, highlighting the limited external validity of traditional methods. We also find that GP effects consistently exceed VC firm effects, suggesting that individual-level analyses provide greater insights than firm-level ones.

performance effects: some studies show that balancing exploration and exploitation yields
superior results, whereas others find that focused commitment to one activity is more advantageous.
We argue that these inconsistencies arise because ambidexterity’s costs and benefits
depend on firms’ resource boundary conditions. Building on the distinction between non–scalefree
resources that impose rivalry and trade-offs and scale-free resources—particularly intangible
assets—that can be redeployed at low marginal cost, we develop a resource-contingent theory
of ambidexterity. Using a panel of 1,314 U.S. public firms from 1980 to 2021, we show that under
scarce non–scale-free resources, performance follows an inverted U-shape and ambidexterity
prevails; under resource slack, the curve reverses and focused strategies dominate. We further
demonstrate that while discontinuous jumps between orientations are typically costly, intangible
assets buffer reconfiguration frictions and can convert discontinuous jumps into performanceenhancing
moves. These findings reconcile prior mixed results by identifying resource redeployability
as the microfoundation that conditions when balance, focus, or discontinuous change
creates value.","ambidexterity, intertemporal transition, firm performance, firm resources, intangible assets",F_W2Lu0CO7V9ung6l,To Balance or Not to Balance.pdf,939222,application/pdf

This effect is more pronounced for firms with superior technologies and those geographically collocated with competitors—factors that enhance firms’ knowledge-spillover concerns––and less pronounced for firms in industries where alternative appropriability mechanisms are highly effective. Moreover, our findings suggest that the increased betweenness centrality of new hires (skilled and junior) serves as an important underlying mechanism for the treatment effect.

To assess the efficacy of this strategy, we conduct a pre-registered field experiment in partnership with an actual startup. The results reveal a counterintuitive effect: explicitly emphasizing autonomy attracts less educated candidates while deterring their more educated counterparts. We propose that this adverse selection may arise from education-contingent differences in interpretation. Specifically, more educated job seekers are more likely to construe this emphasis as (1) a marker of generalist work misaligned with their specialized human capital, (2) a sign of organizational dysfunction stemming from excessive autonomy, (3) a compensating differential substituting for inadequate pecuniary compensation, or (4) simply ""cheap talk"" that undermines employer credibility. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although autonomy is a core attribute that distinguishes entrepreneurial ventures from established firms, its explicit emphasis can paradoxically backfire—undermining efforts to attract the high-ability human capital critical to entrepreneurial success.","entrepreneurship, early joiner, human capital, autonomy, organizational design",F_1dm20nPVebY0LNR,When Autonomy Backfires.pdf,735307,application/pdf

Based on nine months of fieldwork in Peru’s mining industry, this paper examines how one of the world’s largest mining firms sought to manage violent community conflict through social investments. The analysis shows how social investments commodified grievances and turned the community’s use of violent conflict into a calculated transaction, in exchange for social investments. Over time, violent conflict became normalized as an “everyday” activity, rendering the use of social investments to quell conflict ineffective. The findings matter for theory and practice: social investments can fundamentally transform firm-community relations, beyond reducing grievances or stimulating opportunism, in ways that can institutionalize violent community conflict.",Qualitative; Community Stakeholders; Nonmarket Strategy; Social Movements,F_2Qfzh68oeYPuXCG,Commodifying Conflict.pdf,482484,application/pdf

Single-shot experimenters tend to converge on the most promising approach, while multi-experimenters are more likely to diversify to avoid the correlation inherent in pursuing multiple experiments within the same approach.

Our analysis demonstrates that these effects operate conditionally rather than universally. In countries with limited financial development, capital access constraints amplify the substitution effect, as quotas make corporate positions relatively more attractive than entrepreneurship. Conversely, in financially developed economies where women face fewer financing barriers, the inspiration effect predominates, with board representation encouraging venture creation. Beyond quota effects, we find that financial development independently increases women's relative entrepreneurial propensity.

Drawing on a historical analysis of the Buy American movement (2000–2023), we develop a process model of \textit{ideological re-categorization} to explain how grassroots entrepreneurs redefined a market category and reshaped the nationalism that animated it. The process began with grievance-driven entrepreneurs who mobilized economic nationalism to frame domestic production as moral resistance to globalization. Their success turned the movement into a symbolic resource for political elites, who co-opted its narratives and attracted new ideological joiners, redirecting its meaning toward exclusionary partisan nationalism increasingly detached from its material base in manufacturing. By tracing this cycle of legitimation and co-optation, we show how nationalism, as a “thin-centered” ideology, becomes a category-transforming force through its semantic flexibility and emotional resonance.

We refine this reconciliation by showing that while functionally similar, rareness and scarcity operate through sufficiently distinct mechanisms that their interaction creates dynamics interchangeability cannot predict.

Conflicts indicate mechanistic distinction within functional similarity, as identical concepts cannot conflict. We specify boundary conditions determining patterns and examine how resource origins (exogenous versus endogenous) moderate strategic flexibility.

If this assumption holds, then stakeholders who possess less power or salience are likely to be deemed unimportant and consequently overlooked by organizations. In this study, we argue that the nature of the problem is a critical but missing element in existing explanations of stakeholder identification. We replace the firm as the unit of analysis and instead position the problem as the central organizing basis for stakeholder identification. We present a typology of mutuality problems: simple, complex, and wicked. By emphasizing the nature of the problem, our approach enables a more nuanced and dynamic understanding of stakeholder identification, moving beyond rigid categorizations such as powerful versus weak stakeholders. By developing theory at the problem level, we show how organizations can more accurately identify the stakeholders most essential to their long-term survival.","Stakeholder Identification, Stakeholder Management, Stakeholder Theory",F_21tAbgN7iCUqpND,Who Counts and Who Decides Firms%2C Problems%2C and Stakeholder Theory.pdf,503539,application/pdf

Startups’ Market Positioning Relative to Peers and Funding Outcomes in Accelerators,"Startups in accelerators are evaluated in direct comparison with cohort peers, yet we know little about how a venture’s relative market position within its cohort is associated with funding outcomes. Prior research offers competing predictions: optimal distinctiveness theory highlights a trade-off between competitive advantage and legitimacy, while entrepreneurial learning emphasizes the benefits of similarity for knowledge acquisition.  Using data on 3,205 U.S. startups in 189 cohorts across 26 accelerator programs (2005–2018), along with a matched sample of comparable non-accelerated startups, we measure a venture’s cohort market position as its industry similarity to cohort peers. We find an inverted U-shaped relationship between industry similarity and overall funding within two years post-graduation: ventures with moderate distinctiveness raise the most overall capital. In contrast, funding from high-reputation VCs increases with distinctiveness, favoring highly unique market positions. These results reconceptualize cohort effects as relative distinctiveness within the cohort and highlight the critical role of investor attributes—particularly reputation—in shaping funding outcomes.","market position, entrepreneurship, accelerator, funding ",F_w63wJ1rvIfY74hX,acc_how unique_Jan 15  2026ss.pdf,537082,application/pdf

In this study, we argue that this negative effect of racial diversity on support for organizations serving the public interest will be weaker the more inclusive the community, especially where community inclusion is accompanied by shared values among members of different groups and where the organizations themselves are racially representative. We test and find support for these predictions by looking at one specific type of public-service organization: public schools in the
United States. Specifically, we find that community support for public schools—both generally in terms of local spending per pupil and specifically as the bond amounts residents vote to approve—is negatively associated with racial diversity within a school district, but this negative relation only holds for less inclusive communities where members of different groups are less likely to live close to each other or to have social ties with each other. We further find that this moderating effect of community inclusion is complemented by shared values and organizational representativeness, so that diversity has the most negative effect in less inclusive communities where members of different races differ in their political beliefs and schools are relatively segregated, and no significant effect in inclusive communities with shared values and integrated schools. Our study sheds new light on the conditions under which organizations seeking to address grand challenges can benefit from strong community support.","Nonmarket & Political Environment, Public Management, Diversity in Organizations, Organization Design",F_3PhIG9dwt3WpMOv,Other_People’s_Children_How_Diversity_Without_Inclusion_Impacts_Community_Support_for Public_Schools.pdf,3835579,application/pdf

This design isolates changes in complaint responsiveness at moments when enforcement effort discontinuously gains or loses evaluative relevance, allowing us to trace how authorities adjust their behavior around these temporal cutoffs. The observed patterns are consistent with a broader theoretical logic in which bureaucratic incentives are shaped by benchmark-based evaluation systems: enforcement effort is most valuable when it can still affect an impending assessment, loses salience once success has been secured, and can regain meaning when failure becomes unavoidable but remains subject to interpretation. Together, this approach shows that variation in responsiveness to public complaints reflects temporal incentive shifts embedded in evaluation regimes rather than stable differences in regulatory capacity or citizen pressure.",environmental governance; public complaints; bureaucratic incentives; threshold performance evaluation; regression discontinuity in time.,F_3fOuWxJ7WQHITLO,When Timing Matters for Bureaucratic Responsiveness Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity in Time.pdf,1394511,application/pdf

Yet economic profits often depend on stakeholder-controlled resources whose marginal contributions cannot be fully specified or enforced ex ante. When such incompletely contractible inputs are essential to value creation, residual claims extend beyond shareholders, challenging the conditions under which shareholder-centric governance is efficient. This paper develops a theory of how governance shapes strategy selection in these multi-claimant settings by introducing residual-claim ambiguity: uncertainty over how economic profits should be allocated ex post among multiple contributors who bear residual risk. Residual-claim ambiguity expands managerial discretion over profit allocation and, under shareholder-centric governance, weakens the credibility of commitments to nonshareholder contributors. Anticipating unfavorable allocation, stakeholders respond strategically—through influence activities, bargaining frictions, effort shading, and reduced firm-specific investment—generating efficiency losses. These distributional agency costs are distinct from managerial agency costs, transaction costs, and bargaining costs because they arise from discretionary profit allocation under contested residual claims. This paper argues that distributional agency costs vary systematically across profit-generation mechanisms: novelty and unique complementarities heighten ambiguity because they rely on discretionary, hard-to-measure contributions, whereas scale relies more on standardized, contractible inputs that clarify expected returns. Consequently, shareholder-centric governance creates selection pressure toward scale-based profit generation and away from novelty and complementarities, even when the latter offer greater value-creation potential, reframing governance as a determinant of which value-creation pathways are sustainable.

yet little is known about how newly public firms navigate post-IPO growth decisions. In this study, we examine what we term IPO strategic growth pivots by measuring and modeling how post IPO pivots between two different growth modes affect longer-term IPO performance. Note that although there is an ongoing dialogue about two types of IPO growth modes, specifically organic vs. inorganic, to date, we have not seen work that examines the change in growth modes, and that is the focus of the work done in this research. Drawing on longitudinal data from 831 U.S. IPO firms from 2010 to 2015, we analyze how the number of growth-mode pivots affects 5-year firm survival and post-IPO performance. We find that the number of growth-mode pivots exhibits curvilinear relationships with both five-year survival and long-term IPO financial performance. This pattern demonstrates that the rate of change in growth mode pivots entails meaningful costs, a dynamic that is central to change management theory and that helps explain
why performance outcomes depend not only on making changes or pivots but also managing the process by which these pivots are implemented. These findings highlight the complex and outcome-specific consequences of strategic change in the post-IPO context. This study advances research in entrepreneurship and strategic management by elucidating how strategic growth pivots entail distinct trade-offs for survival and performance. The results also offer actionable insights for executives, investors, and policymakers seeking to evaluate or guide strategic decision-making in the high-stakes years following an IPO.","Initial Public Offering, IPO, firm growth, growth pivots, organic and inorganic growth",F_31LgnSEaxeDwSgk,ASSESSING IPO STRATEGIC GROWTH PIVOTS .pdf,524116,application/pdf

We focus on the decision to “institute” a patent challenge. Institution is an administrative decision by the PTAB to rule on the validity of the patented claims. It is highly likely to lead to at least partial invalidation of the patent’s claims, and in most cases leads to the invalidation of all claims. We find that when a challenge to the validity of a standard essential patent (SEP) for 5G wireless networks is instituted in PTAB, it opens space in the technological domain for the rivals of the patent holder to make changes and create new features for the standard. These firms also file for additional patents. When the PTAB challenge is not instituted, meaning that the standard-essential patent was effectively validated, the rivals of the patent holder reduce their related standard contributions and patent filings. We conclude that the PTAB inter-partes review reveals strategically valuable information and allows firms to reposition themselves in the market for standardized technologies.

For example, female employee share at female founded startups are 36.4pp higher after controlling for industry-by-metro area-by-cohort, with the corresponding estimates of 51.2pp for Blacks, 37.3pp for Hispanics, and 11.3pp for non-college individuals. Large effects are present in high-growth startups, across industries and occupations, and remain stable across new firm cohorts. In addition, differences across new firms in the composition of their workers strongly persist over the firm's first ten years. We use wage data to untangle whether the relative differences are driven by labor demand or labor supply effects: group-specific wage decompositions suggest that new firms pay higher relative wages to individuals from similar backgrounds to the entrepreneur. We calibrate a labor demand model using our empirical findings to assess the potential wage impacts of reducing access barriers to entrepreneurial careers, finding quantitatively significant increases in relative wage for women (2.77 percent), Blacks (4.36 percent), and Hispanics (2.26 percent).",Entrepreneurship; hiring,F_3HMPW1fOMYYF7VQ,Who Hires Whom Entrepreneurial Backgrounds and Labor Market Opportunities.pdf,529337,application/pdf

While existing research has examined various organizational responses to stakeholder pressure—including acquiescence, neglect, collaboration, and resistance—they have been predominantly reactive and discrete, overlooking a more systematic approach organizations employ to neutralize stakeholder pressure before it emerges and end it even if it materializes. To address this gap, this paper introduces organizational repression as an integrated strategy aimed at preventing, controlling, or constraining stakeholder collective action from evolving. Drawing on the social movements and state-based repression literatures, we theorize how organizations can effectively undermine collective action by targeting its enabling conditions across three distinct phases: emergence, coalescence and formalization. We propose five key repressive tactics—manipulating threat perceptions, closing opportunity structures, restricting resources, selectively disincentivizing recruits, and fragmenting coalitions of members and allies—and explore how organizations implement each. Ultimately, this paper contributes to the social movements and nonmarket strategy literatures by theorizing organizational repression as a stakeholder management strategy and revealing how organizations can undermine stakeholder efforts to produce organizational and societal change.","Social Movements, Stakeholder Management, Repression",F_2yejiqqcWCyYWfF,Organizational Repression of Stakeholder Collective Action.pdf,875815,application/pdf

How benefits propagate through an agglomeration is unclear because agglomerations are composed of multiple firms and each firm engages in various activities that might have spillover implications for neighbors. To observe this propagation and identify underlying mechanisms, we leverage some firms taking a specific strategic action that generates benefits for themselves that might spill over to neighbors. Focusing on demand-side (vs. supply-side) agglomeration benefits, we expect that neighbors will benefit more when geographically closer to the action-taking firms (due to lower customer search costs) or when selling similar goods to the action-taking firms (due to what customers the strategic action attracts), but benefit less when both geographically closer and selling similar goods (due to localized competition). Using a quasi-natural experiment featuring establishment-level micro-geographic data of restaurants participating in “Restaurant Week” in Washington DC (an event to stimulate demand), we find that Restaurant Week participants’ neighbors experience heightened demand for several weeks after Restaurant Week. Consistent with our expectations: neighbors benefit more when geographically closer or if selling similar goods to Restaurant Week participants. But the benefit for neighbors selling similar goods is delayed a couple weeks, which is consistent with localized competition initially offsetting spillover benefits. Our results demonstrate how firms taking specific strategic action can lead to spillovers propagating throughout an agglomeration, and how overlapping mechanisms determine who benefits and how much.","Agglomeration, geography, demand-side spillovers",F_rqj1uO4KZ5lQJzj,Agglomeration Economy Dynamics and Demand Spillovers.pdf,1554030,application/pdf

For example, existing studies emphasize how incumbents may impede substitution by improving the performance of incumbent technologies such that the substitution threshold shifts upward and becomes unattainable for firms developing new technologies. While such strategic actions by incumbents obstruct the substitution process, surprisingly little is known about the strategic responses available to firms developing new technologies.
We address this lacuna by theorizing shaping as a strategic response available to firms developing new technologies when facing an upward shift in the substitution threshold. Integrating research on technology substitution with the literature on endogenous shaping, we argue that when the substitution threshold becomes unattainable, these firms may attempt to shape the industry’s value proposition by altering consumers’ shared beliefs about the product’s utility and, consequently, about which technological attributes are valuable. This, in turn, redefines the substitution threshold itself, making it attainable again.
We empirically examine our theorization through an in-depth study of the photovoltaic cell industry, combining qualitative and quantitative data. Our analysis reveals a strategic shift among startups following a sharp upward shift in the substitution threshold around 2010, as firms developing new technologies shifted their strategy toward shaping the industry’s value proposition.

Yet, our knowledge of the conditions that accelerate or ameliorate inventor turnover is limited. In this study, we examine how the target inventors’ pre-acquisition productivity and network position shape their post-acquisition mobility decisions. Using data from 139 U.S. technology acquisitions, we find that highly productive inventors and those occupying brokerage positions are less likely to leave. Furthermore, community density, the cohesiveness of a broker’s collaborative community, strengthens this retention effect. We also argue and show that inventor productivity mediates the relationship between brokerage and departure. Our findings advance understanding of post-acquisition human capital retention by specifying individual-level predictors and the mechanisms linking social structure to inventor mobility.","Collaboration / Coordination for Innovation, Social Networks, Mergers and Acquisitions",F_vNRwvb2Gd9jvIzf,Mergers and Acquisitions (M%26A)%2C Inventor Turnover%2C and Network Properties.pdf,657215,application/pdf

This poses critical questions: Are these solutions inclusive, meaning do they serve vulnerable populations? What are their broader impacts on non-recipients? Do they generate broader positive impacts, or do they benefit recipients while disadvantaging non-recipients? These concerns are particularly pertinent when private solutions to social issues coexist with and compete against existing public solutions, potentially reducing the latter’s effectiveness. In this paper, I examine how private solutions to social issues might negatively impact existing public providers. First, private solutions could diminish support for public providers at the local level, leading to fewer resources raised for the public provider by local communities. Second, private providers, if profit-motivated, might serve more economically viable segments, leaving less viable ones to public providers, thereby increasing the latter’s production costs. I explore these mechanisms in the context of US public education, where charter schools (private provider) coexist and compete with traditional public schools (public provider). I find that the entry of charter schools, particularly for-profit ones, reduces local support for traditional public schools (TPS), as evidenced by decreased per-pupil local revenues and fewer successful school referenda for additional funding. Furthermore, using a quasi-natural experiment, I demonstrate that TPS grades exposed to for-profit charter schools see an increase in the proportion of economically disadvantaged and disabled students. I also show that these effects are mostly mitigated if the private provider is organized as a non-profit or if safeguards are put in place to prevent exclusionary behaviors by for-profit private providers.","Organizational Forms, Competition, Social Impact, Social Issues and Grand Challenges, SDG4",F_3QKJ3qBsmjuGqFg,The Exclusive Nature of Private Solutions to Public Problems.pdf,1438321,application/pdf

Analyzing data from 598 nuclear power plant construction projects worldwide between 1951 and 2016, we find that general contractors become slower with experience: each subsequent plant built around a specific reactor model takes over 18 days longer to complete, and unexpected rain slows experienced contractors further. Interviews and archival records illustrate the codification creep underlying these findings. To self-disrupt codification creep, we show that organizations can introduce planned novelty—by intentionally switching to a new containment building technology—to counteract the drag of past experience.","Codification, Organizational Experience, Tacit Knowledge; Explicit Knowledge; Learning; Novelty; Nuclear Energy",F_4MzMrhORpWzvpmx,Codification Creep.pdf,3145886,application/pdf

Yet, platformized journalism increasingly elevates social media narratives—press coverage of viral online content produced by unknown creators seeking to monetize attention. Can such narratives shape managerial cognition, or do managers dismiss them as low-quality inputs to evidence-based decision-making? We examine ‘quiet quitting,’ a news story based on viral TikTok content that received unusually widespread business press coverage in 2022–2023 and framed Gen Z employees as leading a historic rise in counterproductive work behaviors. Our qualitative analysis of news articles (N=170) shows that journalists themselves raised concerns about the narrative’s accuracy, external validity, and newsworthiness, even as the story circulated. Across a series of survey experiments (N=3,167), we find that managers exposed to the dubious quiet quitting narrative did not increase selection of empathetic normative control practices (e.g. town halls, employee surveys). Instead, they significantly increased selection of rational (e.g. pay-for-performance incentives) and coercive control practices (e.g. returning workers to the office, digital surveillance). The narrative activated worker stereotypes about opportunism, and this mechanism persisted even when we provided critical commentary or company-specific indicators of strong work engagement. The findings advance the literature on managerial control by identifying social media narratives as a novel factor that can shape managerial cognition. The study more generally illustrates emerging challenges to collective sensemaking posed by the rising centrality of digital platforms in civic life.

While such regulations aim to increase stakeholder privacy and data security, they can also introduce costs in settings where collecting, analyzing, and sharing sensitive data is central to innovation. We examine this tension in the context of the pharmaceutical industry and the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. Leveraging firm-level variation in exposure to the GDPR, we find that the regulation lowers clinical trials by 18 percent. Firms also shift the types of projects they pursue: trials are less likely to include sites in the EU, be conducted across multiple countries, and target a narrower set of diseases. Research collaborations decline overall and shift away from new partners towards established relationships. When looking at project outcomes, we observe that trials take longer to complete, are less likely to succeed, and report results with greater delay. The decline in clinical trial activity is greatest among young firms. These findings reveal how data privacy regulations shape not only the rate of innovation, but also the process by which it is pursued and its outcomes.",Innovation; Privacy; Regulation; Collaboration; Experimentation,F_3HITVjOjFAxB7q1,Data Privacy Regulation and Innovation.pdf,664347,application/pdf

We construct a novel dataset combining LinkedIn-based employment histories with data on venture capital (VC) investments in U.S. startups. Exploiting the staggered adoption of liability waivers that allow investors to hold stakes in competing business opportunities as a plausibly exogenous shock to common ownership, we show that ventures with shared investors employ more workers, pay higher wages, and experience greater turnover than independent ones. At the same time, common ownership increases job-to-job mobility within investor portfolios, suggesting that shared investors facilitate the reallocation of workers across portfolio firms. Aggregating to the local market level, we find that common ownership significantly increases worker mobility without depressing overall employment or wages, though these positive effects weaken in more concentrated labor markets. Taken together, the results are consistent with coordination synergies that relax matching frictions outweighing potential monopsony effects.",common ownership; human capital; venture capital; competition; innovation,F_9YRdynEN474IyPL,Common Ownership%2C Firm Hiring and the Allocation of Human Capital.pdf,365783,application/pdf

We argue that CEO duality intensifies organizational identification, creating strong impetus for dual CEOs to demonstrate commitment to sustainability norms and secure legitimacy while avoiding the economic and operational costs associated with full transparency. We further theorize that sustainability-specific sensegiving mechanisms, including sustainability-linked compensation and committee, reorient dual CEOs' identification toward substantive environmental action over symbolic reporting, thereby attenuating carbonwashing. Using a sample of 3,218 firm-year observations across 644 firms in 31 countries while addressing endogeneity concerns, we find that CEO duality amplifies carbonwashing, but this effect is significantly attenuated by sustainability-linked bonus and sustainability committee.","Carbonwashing, Satisficing, Organizational identification, Sustainability-specific sensegiving, CEO duality",F_2BeV9erpuoF4oFe,SS_The Limits of Carbon Reporting.pdf,615919,application/pdf

Leveraging a natural experiment created by the staggered adoption of digital paywalls by U.S. local newspapers, along with comprehensive data on S&P 1500 executives’ social media activity, we document several findings. First, following local newspaper paywall adoption, executives of local firms significantly increase their posting activity, consistent with efforts to fill the resulting information and attention void. Second, this heightened activity is accompanied by a marked shift toward impression management content. Third, the capital-market implications of executive posts depend on the information environment: although executive posts reduce information asymmetry when local newspapers remain freely accessible, paywall adoption effectively neutralizes this beneficial effect. Cross-sectional analyses further support the proposed mechanisms. The increase in posting volume is concentrated among firms serving informationally disadvantaged retail investors and attention-sensitive consumers, as well as those with high pre-paywall local newspaper coverage. Meanwhile, the shift toward impression management is strongest among firms previously subjected to high local newspaper scrutiny. Finally, we show that executives’ increased social media communication effectively restores the stakeholder attention lost following paywall adoption.

BOUNDARY CONDITIONS AND LONGITUDINAL EVIDENCE FROM S&P 500 FIRMS,"Strategy research is divided on whether imitation erodes or builds competitive advantage, with contradictory theoretical assumptions and sparse empirical evidence. We address this impasse using text-based measures that capture latent information on imitation as strategic convergence around innovation topics. Analyzing nearly ten thousand annual reports from S&P500 firms across fifteen years, we provide novel large-scale empirical evidence reconciling static and dynamic imitation theories. Imitation benefits shareholder returns and short-term operational performance via capability building but erodes long-term profitability. Critically, we establish boundary conditions: sectoral uncertainty enables learning and amplifies imitation benefits, whereas global uncertainty creates strategic paralysis. Firm strength shows minimal moderation, rendering imitation as a democratic strategy. Our findings integrate temporal, environmental, and organizational contingencies governing when imitation builds versus erodes competitive advantage.",: Imitation; innovation; firm performance; topic modelling; S&P500,F_33Bhbpl6yOIReG8,Manuscript_Imitation.pdf,3865098,application/pdf

Drawing on the awareness–motivation–capability (AMC) framework and integrating insights from psychology, military strategy, and organization studies, the model specifies both the conditions that create surprise and the mechanisms through which it shapes rival response. In the pre-surprise period, detection and interpretation barriers, such as secrecy, irregular behavior, vague or deceptive communication, and limited rival intelligence, impede early warning and delay preparedness. In the post-surprise period, two opposing mechanisms, evaluation barriers and response incentives, jointly determine the speed and effectiveness of rivals’ responses: evaluation barriers (e.g., decision interruptions, appraisal difficulties) constrain capability, while response incentives (e.g., curiosity, fear, anxiety) shape motivation. We develop propositions on how different types of surprise (novel, incongruent, and misleading) activate these mechanisms to produce distinct response outcomes. Our model contributes to (a) competitive dynamics research by embedding the temporal, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of surprise within the AMC framework, (b) first-mover advantage theory by explaining how psychological and informational asymmetries extend lead time, and (c) literature on organizational responses to unexpected events by integrating proactive and reactive perspectives of surprise.
