We focus on the decision to “institute” a patent challenge. Institution is an administrative decision by the PTAB to rule on the validity of the patented claims. It is highly likely to lead to at least partial invalidation of the patent’s claims, and in most cases leads to the invalidation of all claims. We find that when a challenge to the validity of a standard essential patent (SEP) for 5G wireless networks is instituted in PTAB, it opens space in the technological domain for the rivals of the patent holder to make changes and create new features for the standard. These firms also file for additional patents. When the PTAB challenge is not instituted, meaning that the standard-essential patent was effectively validated, the rivals of the patent holder reduce their related standard contributions and patent filings. We conclude that the PTAB inter-partes review reveals strategically valuable information and allows firms to reposition themselves in the market for standardized technologies. In ongoing research, we explore how the characteristics of firms and their positions in the ecosystem moderate these outcomes","Gurneeta Vasudeva Singh, Stephen Jones, Aija Leiponen, Hao Wan",U of Minnesota; U of Washington; Cornell U.,R_100jcb12KPNrplQ_Free to innovate.pdf,R_100jcb12KPNrplQ

Two distinct traditions emerged—Barney’s emphasis on rareness (the degree to which a resource is possessed by few competing firms) and Peteraf’s emphasis on scarcity (the degree to which aggregate demand exceeds available supply)—which Peteraf and Barney (2003) reconciled as “very nearly the same.” While this phrasing left conceptual space for differences, subsequent literature has often treated rareness and scarcity as completely interchangeable. We refine this reconciliation by showing that while functionally similar, rareness and scarcity operate through sufficiently distinct mechanisms that their interaction creates dynamics interchangeability cannot predict. When resources exhibit both characteristics, three patterns emerge: complementary (mechanisms amplify advantage beyond additive effects), substitution (context determines dominance), and conflicting (mechanisms work at cross-purposes—differentiation creating unfulfillable demand, scarcity preventing network effects, or resource allocation dilemmas reducing net advantage below either alone). Conflicts indicate mechanistic distinction within functional similarity, as identical concepts cannot conflict. We specify boundary conditions determining patterns and examine how resource origins (exogenous versus endogenous) moderate strategic flexibility. Our framework refines Peteraf and Barney's reconciliation: functional similarity dominates when one mechanism operates; mechanistic distinctions require specification when both operate simultaneously.","Temitope Oladimeji, Shaker Zahra",University of Massachusetts; University of Minnesota,R_10tNBUVbXEYwifR_When Rareness and Scarcity Interact _ Complementary%2C Substitution%2C and Conflicting Effects in Resource-Based Competitive Advantage.pdf,R_10tNBUVbXEYwifR

While such regulations aim to increase stakeholder privacy and data security, they can also introduce costs in settings where collecting, analyzing, and sharing sensitive data is central to innovation. We examine this tension in the context of the pharmaceutical industry and the European Union’s (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the most comprehensive data privacy regulation to date. Leveraging firm-level variation in exposure to the GDPR, we find that the regulation lowers clinical trials by 18 percent. Firms also shift the types of projects they pursue: trials are less likely to include sites in the EU, be conducted across multiple countries, and target a narrower set of diseases. Research collaborations decline overall and shift away from new partners towards established relationships. When looking at project outcomes, we observe that trials take longer to complete, are less likely to succeed, and report results with greater delay. The decline in clinical trial activity is greatest among young firms. These findings reveal how data privacy regulations shape not only the rate of innovation, but also the process by which it is pursued and its outcomes.","Sukhun Kang, Jennifer Kao",UCSB; UCLA,R_12rOoK4GDNpQmOi_Data Privacy Regulation and Innovation.pdf,R_12rOoK4GDNpQmOi

Using data from the U.S. Census and LinkedIn profiles, we document that entrepreneurs are significantly more likely to hire workers from similar social backgrounds (gender, race, age, education, etc.). These effects are quantitatively large across the demographic dimensions available to us. For example, female employee share at female founded startups are 36.4pp higher after controlling for industry-by-metro area-by-cohort, with the corresponding estimates of 51.2pp for Blacks, 37.3pp for Hispanics, and 11.3pp for non-college individuals. Large effects are present in high-growth startups, across industries and occupations, and remain stable across new firm cohorts. In addition, differences across new firms in the composition of their workers strongly persist over the firm's first ten years. We use wage data to untangle whether the relative differences are driven by labor demand or labor supply effects: group-specific wage decompositions suggest that new firms pay higher relative wages to individuals from similar backgrounds to the entrepreneur. We calibrate a labor demand model using our empirical findings to assess the potential wage impacts of reducing access barriers to entrepreneurial careers, finding quantitatively significant increases in relative wage for women (2.77 percent), Blacks (4.36 percent), and Hispanics (2.26 percent).","Josh Feng, Xavier Jaravel",University of Utah - David Eccles School of Business; London School of Economics,R_16hXk5pPcgzoHqC_Who Hires Whom Entrepreneurial Backgrounds and Labor Market Opportunities.pdf,R_16hXk5pPcgzoHqC

As platforms increasingly require AI-use disclosures, understanding the market consequences of such positioning becomes critical. We examine this using Kickstarter's AI-disclosure policy, analyzing 42,745 crowdfunding campaigns of products launched after its introduction. We compare projects that disclose AI use, projects that adopt anti-AI narratives, and projects that remain silent about AI. Relative to silent projects, AI-disclosing campaigns attract 33\% fewer backers and are 11.9 percentage points less likely to reach their funding goals, whereas anti-AI narratives are associated with 29\% more backers and a 3.9 percentage points higher success rate. Among AI-disclosing projects, framing AI as assisting rather than replacing human work substantially reduces the penalty.

This poses critical questions: Are these solutions inclusive, meaning do they serve vulnerable populations? What are their broader impacts on non-recipients? Do they generate broader positive impacts, or do they benefit recipients while disadvantaging non-recipients? These concerns are particularly pertinent when private solutions to social issues coexist with and compete against existing public solutions, potentially reducing the latter’s effectiveness. In this paper, I examine how private solutions to social issues might negatively impact existing public providers. First, private solutions could diminish support for public providers at the local level, leading to fewer resources raised for the public provider by local communities. Second, private providers, if profit-motivated, might serve more economically viable segments, leaving less viable ones to public providers, thereby increasing the latter’s production costs. I explore these mechanisms in the context of US public education, where charter schools (private provider) coexist and compete with traditional public schools (public provider). I find that the entry of charter schools, particularly for-profit ones, reduces local support for traditional public schools (TPS), as evidenced by decreased per-pupil local revenues and fewer successful school referenda for additional funding. Furthermore, using a quasi-natural experiment, I demonstrate that TPS grades exposed to for-profit charter schools see an increase in the proportion of economically disadvantaged and disabled students. I also show that these effects are mostly mitigated if the private provider is organized as a non-profit or if safeguards are put in place to prevent exclusionary behaviors by for-profit private providers.",Farzam Boroomand,University of South Carolina,R_1EAFrKXVGzMuQvS_The Exclusive Nature of Private Solutions to Public Problems.pdf,R_1EAFrKXVGzMuQvS

Conceptualizing complementary human capital as a superior resource, this study abductively develops the most plausible explanation for these “why” questions through the lens of first-mover advantages (FMA). Drawing on quantitative data on biopharmaceutical innovations since the 1980s, the study traces the process of becoming innovators in the biologics market back to human capital at founding, revealing divergent innovation pathways between incumbents and startups. To explain this variability, a comparative historical analysis of innovators that collectively formed the first group of non-follower pioneers in gene therapy, which emerged from the biologics market, shows that only incumbents were able to achieve first-mover advantages and/or benefits across the two markets. Although lacking such advantages, non-follower startup pioneers competed by forming founding teams with complementary human capital grounded in academic entrepreneurship and by creating value through serial entrepreneurship. In contrast, solely founded startup pioneers compensated for their lack of complementary human capital through employee entrepreneurship.",Julia Y.

These firms must navigate multiple dimensions of uncertainty, including technological feasibility. Moreover, they rely on physical assets to commercialize, making exploration costly. Prior research on entrepreneurial strategy emphasizes experimentation to resolve uncertainty but largely focuses on asset-light settings such as software. Even lean startup methods, which encourage early commercial exploration, are better suited to digital ventures where uncertainty is primarily market-based. Consequently, less is known about the implications of exploration strategy in high-uncertainty, asset-intensive environments. I assembled a novel longitudinal dataset of 13,790 hardware-oriented ventures using primary and archival sources, augmented by machine learning and NLP. Employing multiple empirical strategies, including an exogenous technological development (3D printing), the study finds that parallel exploration improves early commercial outcomes by accelerating market learning and mitigating information frictions, yet risks premature technological lock-in. In contrast, sequential exploration fosters deeper learning, yielding long-run financial and innovation performance.
These results highlight the trade-offs faced by boundedly rational entrepreneurs as they balance resolving uncertainty with enhancing organizational learning. The study extends research on entrepreneurial strategy and experimentation to asset-intensive contexts and delineates the boundary conditions under which lean methods are effective in scaling science and technology ventures.",Vinay Subramanian,"Wharton, University of Pennsylvania",R_1PAvy2AZuq8hHuR_Lean Thinking DeepImpact_Exploration Strategies and Commercialization of Deeptech Ventures.pdf,R_1PAvy2AZuq8hHuR

Analyzing intrafirm collaboration patterns in U.S. patent data from 1,022 high-tech firms between 1976 and 2017, we find that increased trade secret protection is negatively associated with the modularity of inventor collaborations within firms. This effect is more pronounced for firms with superior technologies and those geographically collocated with competitors—factors that enhance firms’ knowledge-spillover concerns––and less pronounced for firms in industries where alternative appropriability mechanisms are highly effective. Moreover, our findings suggest that the increased betweenness centrality of new hires (skilled and junior) serves as an important underlying mechanism for the treatment effect. These results contribute to the literature by illuminating how firms strategize their internal innovation activities for knowledge protection and by underscoring its underlying mechanism.","Eunkwang Seo, Eunkwang Seo, Christopher P.

Results indicate that venture capitalists with a higher degree of patience spend more time on a given deal, invest in much younger firms, and syndicate less with other investors. Instead, risk-averse venture capitalists tend to invest in more mature firms. Importantly, time and risk preferences provide different pathways to success: patient investors are more likely to exit through IPOs, whereas risk-averse investors favor trade sales.","Mario Daniele Amore, Orsola Garofalo, Valerio Pelucco, Cedric Gutierrez",Bocconi University; Copenhagen Business School; LUISS Business School,R_26lM7YicIAXpQO0_Time tells.pdf,R_26lM7YicIAXpQO0

The analysis shows how social investments commodified grievances and turned the community’s use of violent conflict into a calculated transaction, in exchange for social investments. Over time, violent conflict became normalized as an “everyday” activity, rendering the use of social investments to quell conflict ineffective.

Central to this process is a fundamental tension between novelty and feasibility that evaluators, operating under bounded rationality, cannot consider simultaneously and therefore rely on heuristics to guide their evaluations. A common heuristic is criteria-sequencing, in which evaluators prioritize alternative criteria at different evaluation stages. Yet, the idiosyncratic ways evaluators sequence these criteria often introduce inconsistencies, creating significant path dependencies in the process. In this paper, we propose that artificial intelligence (AI) offers a potential lever to structure evaluators’ criteria-sequencing heuristics. Leveraging a field experiment with 353 evaluators, we investigate how the sequencing of AI recommendations focusing on novelty and feasibility shapes the mean and variance of innovation among selected solutions. Our results reveal a mean–variance innovation tradeoff: a feasibility-then-novelty sequence leads to selections with higher mean innovation, whereas a novelty-then-feasibility sequence yields selections with greater innovation variance. Furthermore, a post hoc analysis uncovers that the format accompanying AI recommendations also matters. A dynamic format (i.e., interactive chatbot) increases the innovation variance among selected solutions but reduces their mean innovation relative to a static format (i.e., fixed explanatory content). Because these effects operate independently, our findings show that in AI-augmented evaluations, both the sequence of criteria and the format accompanying AI recommendations shape the mean–variance innovation tradeoff. These differences have important implications for the composition of innovation portfolios. Our paper contributes to innovation evaluation research and to emerging literature on human–AI collaboration in innovation-related contexts.","Cyrille Grumbach, Jacqueline Ng Lane, Georg von Krogh",ETH Zurich; Harvard Business School,R_2LZHaUNn9QVYtQH_StrategyScience_The Mean-Variance Tradeoff.pdf,R_2LZHaUNn9QVYtQH

In a representative survey of German entrepreneurs, delegation has a strong, robust, positive association with incremental innovation; evidence for alternative innovation outcomes or differential effects of delegation depth is limited. This relationship varies slightly with incentives, employee, and founder ability, and is stronger in East Germany, where managerial frictions are larger. While delegation does not free up time for personal activities, it allows entrepreneurs to engage in a greater number of venture activities, especially crafting strategy, and perform them more intensely. Collectively, our findings imply delegation enhances innovation by facilitating entrepreneurs' attention allocation to critical managerial tasks, such as acquiring market and competitor insight or making growth and investment choices.

Our analysis demonstrates that these effects operate conditionally rather than universally. In countries with limited financial development, capital access constraints amplify the substitution effect, as quotas make corporate positions relatively more attractive than entrepreneurship. Conversely, in financially developed economies where women face fewer financing barriers, the inspiration effect predominates, with board representation encouraging venture creation. Beyond quota effects, we find that financial development independently increases women's relative entrepreneurial propensity. These findings underscore that institutional interventions like gender quotas produce heterogeneous outcomes depending on complementary institutional infrastructures, particularly financial systems that determine entrepreneurial feasibility.","Hatameh Ahmadi Harandi, David Gaddis Ross, Dong Hyun Shin",UF; Universoty of Florida; City University of Hong Kong,R_38Sxo1vZdIfXR6s_Board Gender Quotas and Women's Entrepreneurship%3B The Critical Role of Financial Development.pdf,R_38Sxo1vZdIfXR6s

How benefits propagate through an agglomeration is unclear because agglomerations are composed of multiple firms and each firm engages in various activities that might have spillover implications for neighbors. To observe this propagation and identify underlying mechanisms, we leverage some firms taking a specific strategic action that generates benefits for themselves that might spill over to neighbors. Focusing on demand-side (vs. supply-side) agglomeration benefits, we expect that neighbors will benefit more when geographically closer to the action-taking firms (due to lower customer search costs) or when selling similar goods to the action-taking firms (due to what customers the strategic action attracts), but benefit less when both geographically closer and selling similar goods (due to localized competition). Using a quasi-natural experiment featuring establishment-level micro-geographic data of restaurants participating in “Restaurant Week” in Washington DC (an event to stimulate demand), we find that Restaurant Week participants’ neighbors experience heightened demand for several weeks after Restaurant Week. Consistent with our expectations: neighbors benefit more when geographically closer or if selling similar goods to Restaurant Week participants. But the benefit for neighbors selling similar goods is delayed a couple weeks, which is consistent with localized competition initially offsetting spillover benefits. Our results demonstrate how firms taking specific strategic action can lead to spillovers propagating throughout an agglomeration, and how overlapping mechanisms determine who benefits and how much.","Roxanne Jaffe, Siddharth Sharma, Wilbur Chung",Vanderbilt University; Indian School of Business; University of Maryland,R_3OWmRX2XefhEB0d_Agglomeration Economy Dynamics and Demand Spillovers.pdf,R_3OWmRX2XefhEB0d

depend on firms’ resource boundary conditions. Building on the distinction between non–scalefree
resources that impose rivalry and trade-offs and scale-free resources—particularly intangible
assets—that can be redeployed at low marginal cost, we develop a resource-contingent theory
of ambidexterity. Using a panel of 1,314 U.S. public firms from 1980 to 2021, we show that under
scarce non–scale-free resources, performance follows an inverted U-shape and ambidexterity
prevails; under resource slack, the curve reverses and focused strategies dominate. We further
demonstrate that while discontinuous jumps between orientations are typically costly, intangible
assets buffer reconfiguration frictions and can convert discontinuous jumps into performanceenhancing
moves. These findings reconcile prior mixed results by identifying resource redeployability
as the microfoundation that conditions when balance, focus, or discontinuous change
creates value.","Luiz Ricardo Kabbach de Castro, Arthur Guimarães Heleno, Luiz Ricardo Kabbach de Castro",Indiana University; Universidad de Navarra,R_3kNTV5GHIpitNlN_To Balance or Not to Balance.pdf,R_3kNTV5GHIpitNlN

Drawing on the awareness–motivation–capability (AMC) framework and integrating insights from psychology, military strategy, and organization studies, the model specifies both the conditions that create surprise and the mechanisms through which it shapes rival response. In the pre-surprise period, detection and interpretation barriers, such as secrecy, irregular behavior, vague or deceptive communication, and limited rival intelligence, impede early warning and delay preparedness. In the post-surprise period, two opposing mechanisms, evaluation barriers and response incentives, jointly determine the speed and effectiveness of rivals’ responses: evaluation barriers (e.g., decision interruptions, appraisal difficulties) constrain capability, while response incentives (e.g., curiosity, fear, anxiety) shape motivation. We develop propositions on how different types of surprise (novel, incongruent, and misleading) activate these mechanisms to produce distinct response outcomes. Our model contributes to (a) competitive dynamics research by embedding the temporal, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of surprise within the AMC framework, (b) first-mover advantage theory by explaining how psychological and informational asymmetries extend lead time, and (c) literature on organizational responses to unexpected events by integrating proactive and reactive perspectives of surprise.","Goce Andrevski, Ali Ahmadi, Danny Miller",Queen's University; HEC Montreal,R_3kXq6YgMqWIak1i_Competitive surprise.pdf,R_3kXq6YgMqWIak1i

To address this gap, this paper introduces organizational repression as an integrated strategy aimed at preventing, controlling, or constraining stakeholder collective action from evolving. Drawing on the social movements and state-based repression literatures, we theorize how organizations can effectively undermine collective action by targeting its enabling conditions across three distinct phases: emergence, coalescence and formalization. We propose five key repressive tactics—manipulating threat perceptions, closing opportunity structures, restricting resources, selectively disincentivizing recruits, and fragmenting coalitions of members and allies—and explore how organizations implement each. Ultimately, this paper contributes to the social movements and nonmarket strategy literatures by theorizing organizational repression as a stakeholder management strategy and revealing how organizations can undermine stakeholder efforts to produce organizational and societal change.","Natalie Holzaepfel, Olga Hawn, Timothy Werner",University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; University of Texas at Austin,R_3lEw1lvqgleTueJ_Organizational Repression of Stakeholder Collective Action.pdf,R_3lEw1lvqgleTueJ

For example, existing studies emphasize how incumbents may impede substitution by improving the performance of incumbent technologies such that the substitution threshold shifts upward and becomes unattainable for firms developing new technologies. While such strategic actions by incumbents obstruct the substitution process, surprisingly little is known about the strategic responses available to firms developing new technologies.
We address this lacuna by theorizing shaping as a strategic response available to firms developing new technologies when facing an upward shift in the substitution threshold. Integrating research on technology substitution with the literature on endogenous shaping, we argue that when the substitution threshold becomes unattainable, these firms may attempt to shape the industry’s value proposition by altering consumers’ shared beliefs about the product’s utility and, consequently, about which technological attributes are valuable. This, in turn, redefines the substitution threshold itself, making it attainable again.
We empirically examine our theorization through an in-depth study of the photovoltaic cell industry, combining qualitative and quantitative data. Our analysis reveals a strategic shift among startups following a sharp upward shift in the substitution threshold around 2010, as firms developing new technologies shifted their strategy toward shaping the industry’s value proposition. 
This study expands the repertoire of strategic responses available to new technology firms during substitution processes and advances research on endogenous shaping by identifying conditions under which shaping emerges and how the process unfolds.","Charlotte Jacobs, Gwendolyn Lee",Louisiana State University; Purdue University,R_3mmd0Ag0I9DHBSj_Shaping an industry value proposition.pdf,R_3mmd0Ag0I9DHBSj

To assess the efficacy of this strategy, we conduct a pre-registered field experiment in partnership with an actual startup. The results reveal a counterintuitive effect: explicitly emphasizing autonomy attracts less educated candidates while deterring their more educated counterparts. We propose that this adverse selection may arise from education-contingent differences in interpretation. Specifically, more educated job seekers are more likely to construe this emphasis as (1) a marker of generalist work misaligned with their specialized human capital, (2) a sign of organizational dysfunction stemming from excessive autonomy, (3) a compensating differential substituting for inadequate pecuniary compensation, or (4) simply ""cheap talk"" that undermines employer credibility. Together, our findings demonstrate that, although autonomy is a core attribute that distinguishes entrepreneurial ventures from established firms, its explicit emphasis can paradoxically backfire—undermining efforts to attract the high-ability human capital critical to entrepreneurial success.","Saerom (Ronnie) Lee, Reuben Hurst",The Wharton School; University of Maryland,R_43StDMdJX5EBsFX_When Autonomy Backfires.pdf,R_43StDMdJX5EBsFX

The data were analyzed using thematic analysis, enabling the identification of processes related to sensing, seizing, and transforming capabilities. The findings show that sensing capabilities emerge through close engagement with sustainability challenges embedded in local contexts, often supported by informal research and experimentation. Seizing capabilities involve mobilizing resources and legitimacy while responding to normative pressures and market expectations surrounding sustainable products. Transforming capabilities become critical as ventures scale, requiring technological adaptation, process formalization, and continuous navigation of regulatory constraints.

Leveraging a natural experiment created by the staggered adoption of digital paywalls by U.S. local newspapers, along with comprehensive data on S&P 1500 executives’ social media activity, we document several findings. First, following local newspaper paywall adoption, executives of local firms significantly increase their posting activity, consistent with efforts to fill the resulting information and attention void. Second, this heightened activity is accompanied by a marked shift toward impression management content. Third, the capital-market implications of executive posts depend on the information environment: although executive posts reduce information asymmetry when local newspapers remain freely accessible, paywall adoption effectively neutralizes this beneficial effect. Cross-sectional analyses further support the proposed mechanisms. The increase in posting volume is concentrated among firms serving informationally disadvantaged retail investors and attention-sensitive consumers, as well as those with high pre-paywall local newspaper coverage. Meanwhile, the shift toward impression management is strongest among firms previously subjected to high local newspaper scrutiny. Finally, we show that executives’ increased social media communication effectively restores the stakeholder attention lost following paywall adoption.","Tiancheng Wang, Philipp Meyer-Doyle, Guoli Chen",INSEAD,R_5FznJ30xQI7rfjz_Executives’ Use of Social Media as an Information Channel.pdf,R_5FznJ30xQI7rfjz

We find that the number of growth-mode pivots exhibits curvilinear relationships with both five-year survival and long-term IPO financial performance. This pattern demonstrates that the rate of change in growth mode pivots entails meaningful costs, a dynamic that is central to change management theory and that helps explain
why performance outcomes depend not only on making changes or pivots but also managing the process by which these pivots are implemented. These findings highlight the complex and outcome-specific consequences of strategic change in the post-IPO context.

Analyzing 31,769 patent-teams in the U.S. electronics industry (1996–2005), we find that teams with greater exposure to the mobility shock exhibit significantly higher knowledge similarity among members post-treatment. This effect is attenuated when potentially mobile inventors have extensive prior collaborative relationships with teammates, suggesting that relational embeddedness substitutes for compositional redundancy as an alternative insurance mechanism.

The process began with grievance-driven entrepreneurs who mobilized economic nationalism to frame domestic production as moral resistance to globalization. Their success turned the movement into a symbolic resource for political elites, who co-opted its narratives and attracted new ideological joiners, redirecting its meaning toward exclusionary partisan nationalism increasingly detached from its material base in manufacturing. By tracing this cycle of legitimation and co-optation, we show how nationalism, as a “thin-centered” ideology, becomes a category-transforming force through its semantic flexibility and emotional resonance.

Yet economic profits often depend on stakeholder-controlled resources whose marginal contributions cannot be fully specified or enforced ex ante. When such incompletely contractible inputs are essential to value creation, residual claims extend beyond shareholders, challenging the conditions under which shareholder-centric governance is efficient. This paper develops a theory of how governance shapes strategy selection in these multi-claimant settings by introducing residual-claim ambiguity: uncertainty over how economic profits should be allocated ex post among multiple contributors who bear residual risk. Residual-claim ambiguity expands managerial discretion over profit allocation and, under shareholder-centric governance, weakens the credibility of commitments to nonshareholder contributors. Anticipating unfavorable allocation, stakeholders respond strategically—through influence activities, bargaining frictions, effort shading, and reduced firm-specific investment—generating efficiency losses. These distributional agency costs are distinct from managerial agency costs, transaction costs, and bargaining costs because they arise from discretionary profit allocation under contested residual claims. This paper argues that distributional agency costs vary systematically across profit-generation mechanisms: novelty and unique complementarities heighten ambiguity because they rely on discretionary, hard-to-measure contributions, whereas scale relies more on standardized, contractible inputs that clarify expected returns. Consequently, shareholder-centric governance creates selection pressure toward scale-based profit generation and away from novelty and complementarities, even when the latter offer greater value-creation potential, reframing governance as a determinant of which value-creation pathways are sustainable.",Adam P Clark,Chapman University,R_6jPKKMgZjecY2pr_The Governability of Strategy_ Residual-Claim Ambiguity and Strategy Selection Under Shareholder-Centric Governance.pdf,R_6jPKKMgZjecY2pr

Yet, platformized journalism increasingly elevates social media narratives—press coverage of viral online content produced by unknown creators seeking to monetize attention. Can such narratives shape managerial cognition, or do managers dismiss them as low-quality inputs to evidence-based decision-making? We examine ‘quiet quitting,’ a news story based on viral TikTok content that received unusually widespread business press coverage in 2022–2023 and framed Gen Z employees as leading a historic rise in counterproductive work behaviors. Our qualitative analysis of news articles (N=170) shows that journalists themselves raised concerns about the narrative’s accuracy, external validity, and newsworthiness, even as the story circulated. Across a series of survey experiments (N=3,167), we find that managers exposed to the dubious quiet quitting narrative did not increase selection of empathetic normative control practices (e.g. town halls, employee surveys). Instead, they significantly increased selection of rational (e.g. pay-for-performance incentives) and coercive control practices (e.g. returning workers to the office, digital surveillance). The narrative activated worker stereotypes about opportunism, and this mechanism persisted even when we provided critical commentary or company-specific indicators of strong work engagement. The findings advance the literature on managerial control by identifying social media narratives as a novel factor that can shape managerial cognition.

We test and find support for these predictions by looking at one specific type of public-service organization: public schools in the
United States. Specifically, we find that community support for public schools—both generally in terms of local spending per pupil and specifically as the bond amounts residents vote to approve—is negatively associated with racial diversity within a school district, but this negative relation only holds for less inclusive communities where members of different groups are less likely to live close to each other or to have social ties with each other. We further find that this moderating effect of community inclusion is complemented by shared values and organizational representativeness, so that diversity has the most negative effect in less inclusive communities where members of different races differ in their political beliefs and schools are relatively segregated, and no significant effect in inclusive communities with shared values and integrated schools.

We develop a computational model that shows how generalization makes learning more efficient by spreading feedback across related alternatives, but this efficiency comes at the cost of increased omission errors. The model further predicts that the optimal degree of generalization depends on the nature of the firm's prior experience. We test these predictions using data on clinical trial failures. Consistent with the model, pharmaceutical firms reduce investment in biologically related drug targets, with the most significant declines occurring for proximate high-merit targets. The effects are larger for firms with more limited or concentrated experience, suggesting that generalization is an imperfect yet useful substitute for direct knowledge.

The observed patterns are consistent with a broader theoretical logic in which bureaucratic incentives are shaped by benchmark-based evaluation systems: enforcement effort is most valuable when it can still affect an impending assessment, loses salience once success has been secured, and can regain meaning when failure becomes unavoidable but remains subject to interpretation. Together, this approach shows that variation in responsiveness to public complaints reflects temporal incentive shifts embedded in evaluation regimes rather than stable differences in regulatory capacity or citizen pressure.","Zhiyan Wu, Huibin Du, Panni Li, Zhongguo Lin",Zhejiang University; Tianjin University; Xi’an Jiaotong University,R_8myJDM1aDS5MfRb_When Timing Matters for Bureaucratic Responsiveness Evidence from a Regression Discontinuity in Time.pdf,R_8myJDM1aDS5MfRb

Single-shot experimenters tend to converge on the most promising approach, while multi-experimenters are more likely to diversify to avoid the correlation inherent in pursuing multiple experiments within the same approach. We test these predictions using data from pharmaceutical R&D. A unit increase in the average experimenter scale is associated with a 0.76 standard deviation increase in the diversity of targets deployed in a therapeutic class–year.

P059,When Hostility Fuels Cooperation: National Animosity and Multinational Firms’ Use of CSR Strategic Alliances,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/xyynh1itaxt6qq3a3u5wp/R_9n8IVT3C8wFhk7t_When-Hostility-Fuels-Cooperation-2C-National-Animosity-and-Multinational-Firms-Use-of-CSR-Strategic-Alliances.pdf?rlkey=5j4t04hn402ntbrcamlb03xqg&dl=0,National animosity; CSR alliances; Geopolitical risk; Visibility,"Cross-border alliances are typically understood as fragile under conditions of political hostility. Challenging this view, we develop a signaling-based theory of how multinational corporations (MNCs) strategically adapt alliance portfolios in response to national animosity. We argue that national animosity heightens MNCs’ reputational vulnerability and impression-management pressures, motivating firms to form CSR strategic alliances as observable, partner-endorsed signals of social responsibility in host countries. We further theorize that this tendency is amplified when host-country geopolitical risk politicizes stakeholder evaluations and when firm visibility magnifies reputational spillovers. Analyses of U.S. MNCs operating across host countries support these arguments. Our study reconceptualizes hostility not only as a constraint on collaboration but also as a condition that reshapes firms’ alliance choices toward credibility-enhancing governance forms.","Jiawen MA, Jian HU",Hong Kong Metropolitan University; Singapore Management University,R_9n8IVT3C8wFhk7t_When Hostility Fuels Cooperation%2C National Animosity and Multinational Firms’ Use of CSR Strategic Alliances.pdf,R_9n8IVT3C8wFhk7t
P060,Beyond Pecuniary Incentives: How Openness-Preserving IPR Shapes Cumulative Innovation,https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/h7xb9zlx7g8jvfi3t7zrn/R_9nfO5YEMcjZMdmp_Beyond-Pecuniary-Incentives-How-Openness-Preserving-IPR-Shapes-Cumulative-Innovation.pdf?rlkey=byacg1p8v0008juffau2ivxoc&dl=0,"intellectual property rights, cumulative innovation, open source, intrinsic motivation","A central assumption in innovation policy is that stronger intellectual property rights (IPR) hinder cumulative innovation. This view, however, largely rests on the premise that innovators are primarily extrinsically motivated. We challenge this assumption by examining how IPR affects cumulative innovation when contributors are intrinsically motivated and when IPR is designed to preserve openness. Using a quasi-natural experiment from a landmark lawsuit, we implement a difference-in-differences analysis on GitHub repositories. We find that strengthened copyleft enforcement increases both the quantity and novelty of external follow-on innovations. We further find that a stronger openness-preserving IPR regime can amplify the use of available knowledge in cumulative innovation. Our findings extend the dominant IPR framework built around rent maximizing agents and exclusion rights by highlighting how the impact of IPR depends on what is being protected and on the motivations driving those who contribute to follow-on innovation.","Jiahua SUN, Nianchen HAN, Shaoqin TANG, Liang CHEN",Singapore Management University; Nanyang Technological University; University of Colorado Boulder,R_9nfO5YEMcjZMdmp_Beyond Pecuniary Incentives How Openness-Preserving IPR Shapes Cumulative Innovation.pdf,R_9nfO5YEMcjZMdmp
